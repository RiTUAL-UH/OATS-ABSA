decent hotel As others have said, this place is nothing special, but for the price and location, it's actually very special. The actual room is a perfectly adequate budget motel room, except that our room had a view of coit tower, transamerica building, and the rest of downtown sf. From what I could see, other more expensive hotels near the area probably can't claim to have the view that we did. And that also means that you can walk to all kinds of great places and take the bus to others. Now if the kind people at the Columbus could only bring some sunshine and warmth to the city, then you would really have something.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great location and service Perfect location on the waterfront. Great views of the city. Light , tasty and affordable meals at the downstairs tavern area and cafe. Loved the in-room computer, the plush bathrobes provided, and the gratuity-inclusive service. Very nice pool and exercise area.

Great Hotel This is a great hotel, on arrival we were upgraded without asking to a delux room with great views of a wonderful city.

Fantastic Value After reading reviews on the Moore, my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location. We were not disappointed. Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value. Our only knock would be that there was no A/C, which could be a problem on a very hot day as the room gets full afternoon sun.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
Heed noise warnings! I want to echo earlier reviews: Da House centrally located, inexpensive, and beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. It is, however, LOUD. There are interior rooms that are quieter, but they do not have windows that open to the outside. Da House is not for people who want to go to sleep before 3 am.####[['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
I love this hotel This hotel is fabulous. The location is great, the staff are lovely, helpful and so keen to help and make your stay memorable. The rooms are nicely decorated and i like the quirkly design which follow through from the rooms to the lobby area. I loved the lobby, it was cosy with the fire going and felt like someone's living room rather than a hotel lobby!!The free wine for an hour every evening was nice, you got to see everyone in the hotel and have a chat if you felt like it!!There are endless great resturants in San Francisco, really spolit for choice, especially if you like seafood!!Great hotel, great location, fabulous stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Great Deal Had a nice stay here. Staff was cordial. Modern decor in the East Tower was fine. Could see that mildew beginning to build up on the bath tiles will contribute to poor maintenance. Would like to recommend Cibo restuarant on 2nd and 41st for a quiet dinner; prix fixed-3 courses seasonal menu, many choices for $30. The new Amish market on 45th is like a mini Whole Foods.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you're driving a car. The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address; according to the GPS in our rented car, the address did not even exist. It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport (if one doesn't take a shuttle), and consequently we almost missed our plane. We arrived late to check-in at the hotel (just before midnight), yet our room STILL was not ready for us. We certainly do not recommend this hotel.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative']]

Yikes! My family and I stayed here, and I really disliked the hotel. First thing, the room was really small and squeezy. The breakfast shouldn't even be called breakfast, the food looks gross!!

I'm gonna make sure my parents don't make us stay there again...####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Simply Fine, Incredible Value Almost everything was just right. Small hotel, front desk and bell staff unobtrusive and HELPFUL, elevators work well, bed very comfortable room clean and well supplied with basics like 4 glasses changed daily, microwave oven and small 'fridge handy, and supremely knowledgable concierge. Overall, incredible value for NYC.Location - theater district and restaurant row - not bad, although going south on 8th is very down-scale (but feels safe--lots of police blending in everywhere--never got an aggressive vibe from police or civilians). . Firestation around the corner never bothered us with noise, even though room faced the street (on 15th floor may have helped--that height certainly helped make the room bright and airy feeling.)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
Great little place in the center of it all We absolutely loved Barcelona and Hotel Rialto was a good base for us.

Wow, what a great little hotel. My wife and I loved the hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was quiet (exactly what we asked for), the atmosphere was great and we both loved the old world charm of the histiric building. Great shopping nearby and an easy walk to most of downtown San Francisco. We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation. This is the second time my wife stayed at the Beresford and it was as a result of her first stay (10 years ago) that we decided to stay there this time, neither of us regretted that decision and we will certainly be staying there the next time we visit San Franciso.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

BEST OF THE BEST BY FAR Being a frequent traveller for both business and pleasure, I have to say that Hotel De L'Europe has been one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed at. The location is excellent, the service is friendly and impecable and the rooms are spotless. It is both an architectural and historical monument and for all of us who are smokers it is still offering not only smoking rooms but also a wonderful smoking lounge with a beautiful view. Both restaurants in the hotel are considered to be of the best in Amsterdam and finally special thanks to the Concierge for all their helpful information.

Go for the regency club--worth extra $$$ My husband and I stayed here and the staff, amenities and hotel made it one of the best vacations we've ever taken. The service was attentive, the rooms and grounds breathtaking. What an amazing view of the ocean to wake up to every morning! Lastly, booking at the Regency Club level meant a room in the top 6 floors with ocean view as well as buffet breakfast every morning AND cocktails and happy hour snacks (like chicken wings, kalua pork, shrimp) every night!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

Decent hotel at Fisherman's Wharf This is the second time we've stayed at the Wharf Inn. It's reasonably priced, very close to Fisherman's Wharf, has free parking for one car, and the rooms are OK. Stay away from the mini-suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason  Bay; it's one of the noisiest hotel rooms I've ever had the pleasure of being moved from. Great view, though. If you want quiet, you have to put up with the view of the adjacent building.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

at the monge again Exactly half a year after our first stay in the Hotel Monge we stayed here again for 4 nights. After reading some of the very negative reviews here I was slightly worried if hte positive impression we had had mabye changed. But no; we enjoyed the time there as much as before. The room was extremely clean, enough space for 3 people, the location just always again is simply perfect for buying food, going for walks (Jardin de plantes!) or simply wathcing people. So I still highly recommend this Hotel for people who don麓t want to spend too much money but want to have a nice, clean and friendly stay in a lovely area of Paris!####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]

fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor, and yet again have not been let down. This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona, the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel, to when you leave. We had a standard room for four nights, and it was just what we needed, I understand that there are better rooms, but this was above what you normally get in this price range. There was plenty of space, the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy, Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas, but when its cold and wet, we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway. All in all a great hotel, and will be stopping again in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive']]
Great hotel in the middle of nowhere Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed by the hotel, modern, fun and great rooms sizes although it does have a bit of a conference centre feel to it. Had a room on one of the top floors which offered the most spectacular views. The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit. Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
A Little gem Myself and my partner stayed here for a long weekend from Dublin, the staff wee very helpful and friendly hotel itself is in a lovely location and extremely quiet.

Superb hotel for a superb stay in SF You will not be disappointed with this hotel. The Rooms are spacious, cosy, bright and airy.

Horrendous customer service Overall, stay was just okay, but was tainted by management's unwillingness to honor their own quoted/written and confirmed total cost. At check-out, ended up paying additional 10% because of hotel's error in confirmation, even after being told at check-in that they would honor confirmed price. For this alone, would never recommend or stay there again, and we do intend to visit San Juan again. Conceptually, hotel was great architectural idea. Interior build-out, however, was done way too frugally, and there was lots of deferred maintainance in room.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Nice hotel with a European feel Ace was a very nice clean place and the staff was absolutley fabulous. The location was great and so was the continental breakfast.

mfortable base for touring New York We stayed at the Eastgate Tower hotel during the October downpours in New York. We found the hotel very comfortable, with a huge suite including a living area, large bed, decent bathroom and usable kitchen. Compared to similar priced hotels in New York, it earns its above average rating. The location is good for the mid-town attractions, and also has good bus and subway links to SoHo, Greenwich Village, etc. Despite the torrential rain, we enjoyed our stay and still managed to have a fantastic time!!####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Supportive Familiy-like Staff My friends and I were some of the many evacuees who waited until the last minute to get out of town before hurricane Katrina. During such a scarey time, the hotel staff became like family in that they did EVERYTHING in their power to make our stay there as comfortable as possible....not easy with the limited resources that were available after the storm hit. Our safety was their highest priority, however they did their best to keep everyone as comfortable as possible during those very unforgetable days. I do plan to stay at the Hotel Le Cirque again...if only just to thank the staff for being there for us.####[['service general', 'positive']]

The Perfect Stay in Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hotel about a month ago and thought is was the ideal place to stay in Barcelona. We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris, so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury.

Pure Quality, if you don't mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week. Had a great room overlooking the church (17th floor). I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal, service was good and the bar area was impressive. This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside, but you do pay for it - (my room rate was of around $600 a night).Overall very happy with the hotel, though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $27.####[['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights' stay at the NY Palace, I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC. My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality, the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick Cathedral on top of those, the use of the lounge was a great boon for us, supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant, friendly and civilized surroundings, the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not-so-friendly city as New York. Also, unlike what was written in a previous preview, we were there with our five yrs old child (having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level) and he was always made to feel at home (I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there). I will definitely return to the Palace.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter, picking the location for it's convenience for the airport for a flight the next day. Rooms are small and functional, bathroom 'unit' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed. Bedding was a little strange, with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers. Staff were efficient, breakfast in the morning was good and transfer to airport was on time (despite being chargeable which is not what was advertised). It's a decent enough place, even if you still get some noise from aircraft due it's proximity to the runway.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
More like a Backpackers Hostel than a hotel. Hotel is on the noisest corner in Waikiki, Rooms have old chipped paint, smelly drain fron sink, poor beds, not very impressed at all.

Immaculate, vintage hotel with personable staff--worth the price This impeccably-restored, 1880's era hotel is clean and quiet and wonderfully located in a popular historic district near the waterfront. Our train was delayed and the night desk clerk cheerfully greeted us at 3 AM and even held the door for us. The breakfast, including hard-boiled eggs, various cereals and fresh batter with waffle-maker, was delicious.

Location, Location, Location -- and a great hotel Just returned from staying three nights at the Chancellor Hotel and have to say that all the Trip Advisor reviews were right on the money. We enjoyed the above-par service, the clean and cozy room (yes, a little tight but workable), the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24/7, and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere -- all at a very reasonable price. Best of all, the hotel is totally non smoking!! Location is perfect, right near Union Square and in front of a cable car stop, within walking distance of many fine resturaunts and shopping areas.

Great affordable place to stay I stayed for two nights last weekend and had a perfectly enjoybale stay. I knew not to expect the Ritz, I did get a clean, comfy bed, a shower and sink with plenty of hot water and good water pressure, and a nice flat screen TV with cable. I was on my own and was out most of the time exploring NYC, but I had a very nice room to come home to. The room was quiet and the lock on the door was very sturdy.

Stylish, friendly I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it. The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera, ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district. Breakfast was a lavish cold buffet, everything was superband included in the price. Drinks at the bar were expensive though. If I should be so lucky as to return to SF, I would want to stay again.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
great hotel food was fine,plenty , one thing about the help.... we had the royal suites. I must commend Ahmed for the excellent service, also Pedro, and Galven at the bar. A few dollars and compliments go a long way. I admit there is a language barrier but after all, it is a spanish speeking country.... Loved the room would definately go back again.....####[['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Dirty and stuffy hotel We booked a hotel through the travel agent and she assured us that this hotel is a very nice hotel with a very good location. Lo and behold! it is a dump. the bathtub was so dirty and the room was so stuffy.we were shortchanged, so i called our travel agent by overseas to complain. with the assistance of her travel agent partner there, we were transferred a a better hotel in the area.never, ever set foot in this dump unless you want to ruin your vacation.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used (think they may have gone out of business now as can't find them any more) to the Hotel Piet Hein. When we arrived thought nice hotel, only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel's annex which was a few doors down the same street. Absolute nightmare of a room, up three flights of very steep stairs, room very dirty, ripped curtains, mould in bathroom, stained carpets, etc. Didn't get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in. In short, not somewhere I would reccomend. That said, things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago, but beware when booking, make sure its the main hotel which is really nice.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Uber-fantastic-hotel Great weekend getaway to the Commonwealth. Fantastic bed, linens, pillows -- could have slept until check out. I swear there were 2 kinds of toilet paper as well -- quilted and regular. Never seen that before. A bit annoyed by the $34 a night for parking, but would happily stay again and again. Will hope to try the hotel's bars / restaurants next time!####[['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Brought home bedbugs Beautiful setting, but vast hotel and a little impersonal. Okay beach on a separate island that you have to take a boat to (free, every half hour). The rooms are a little worn. The worst part was that when I returned home (after having stayed only at the ElCon) I brought home bedbugs. And that's not a joke.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great We went to the Ocean Bavaro hotel back in july this year. The staff were great and they worked really hard and long hours and always smiled. The food was nice but nothing over the top.

Heavenly stay My stay at the Westin Park Central truly was Heavenly. I can't remember a better nights sleep away from home. The room was clean, service was okay, but I can't get over how comfortable the bed was! And you must have a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice in the morning. If you are looking for a good nights sleep and to wake refreshed, this is your stop.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Start Spreading the Muse... We stayed at the Muse a few weeks ago (Feb 08). It was a fantastic experience. The staff was great, the room was spacious (by NY standards) and the bed was very, very comfortable. You cannot beat the location of the hotel - a half block from Times Square and right in the middle of everthing. The price was reasonable (again, by NY standards) and we would return tomorrow if we could.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Mass toerism After one week staying at Meridien Nirwana we moved for another week to Melia. As we arrived we were surprised by all the loudly people laying at the pool and the beach. It seemed we arrvived in Spain or Turkey. Really this hotel is not worth a 5 star rating. After one night staying we packed our bags and left the hotel.####[['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Excellent Location I stayed at this hotel for pleasure using Marriott Reward points for 2 nights. The hotel is ideally situated in the Circular Quay area, only 3 minutes from the City Train stop from the airport. Circular Quay is also where the Opera House and the Ferries are located allowing easy access to all of Syndney, including the Rocks area, Harbor Bridge, shopping, Rocks market, and ferries to Manly and everywhere else. The hotel was also within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants in the Rocks area. The room provided was better than average for Marriott, with all amenities and nice shower.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
great location Location is great, near corner of Orchard and Scotts. Club lounge is nice, although no hot offering at breakfast, which although ok for my wife, expect a hot offering at Grand Hyatt Grand Clubs (best is in HK). Stayed in a junior suite with wife and two kids (combo business and holiday). Great room, plenty of space, although bed is very firm (westin heavenly beds are clearly superior). Would stay agai####[['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
great little hotel My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights art start of july and it was perfect for what we wanted - a real find. Located in quiet area but a quick 15-20 mins walk to San Marco square. Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was lovely (far surpassed expectations, Fruit, croissants, cheese, meat and lovely coffee made fresh from espresso maker) served in the little courtyard. While it has a 2 star rating, its because it doesn't have things like elevators, a big fancy lobby or iron for guests, but everything else about it was 4 star!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative']]
problems remedied Beautiful hotel, great location. My first room had carpet stains; they moved me to another. It was quite cold and the thermostat had no effect when I raised it. They quickly sent a repairman. Ten minutes later, nice warm air and no more problems. No hotel is perfect, so high marks for quick fixes at the Sofitel, D.C.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge -but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Divine! This hotel, with its immaculately clean and well-fitted rooms, situated at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, is the perfect base for any holiday in this extraordinarily beautiful, safe and secure city. The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful, the service is splendid, however what really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the Breakfast Room on the 6th Floor with its stunning views of the Duomo, the Campanile and a myriad of terra-cotta rooftops. What an environment to enjoy a truly sumptuous buffet breakfast that really sets you up for the day!####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Good airport hotel My son, husband and I recently stayed at this hotel and we would recommend it. It's a nice clean hotel and it's convienently located right next to the airport. Although it is literally right next to the airport, we couldn't hear any airport noise from our room, which was nice. If you're looking for a reasonably priced, good hotel I would recommend this one.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Fantastic trip We stayed for four nights at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in June 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic. The one bedroom suite is fabulous and great for the money. Its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite which is great. The staff were always helpful, plus on the day we were leaving they let us have our room for half a day extra at no charge. We enjoyed our stay at and will go there again 100% for sure!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
A happy accident We were put into this hotel by BA when our aircraft developed a mechanical problem and the return flight to London had to be delayed until the next day. In every way the Sheraton Gateway was better than the Holiday Inn at LAX where we spent the first night of our recent holiday. The lobby staff were efficient, the food and service in the restaurant were good and our room was great. We will definitely consider returning to this hotel when we stay at LAX again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
loved the beat - great loaction We stayed here for 2 nights in january 2005. The hotel is superbly placed on the Bourbon, however, the downside to that could be the noise. Our room was on the top floor, but on the corner of Bourbon street and Toulouse.......... therefore the beat from the clubs could be felt. However, the room was so comfortbale, an dthe bed such a joy, indeed i had the nicest sleeps here in 10 days touring the deep south.......####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Good price/performance Comfortable, clean hotel with friendly employees. Good restaurant for your breakfast and dinner. Double rooms rather small but good for short stays. Five minutes by car to Universal Studios !!!!!

Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms, so we decided to try this (based on reviews from TripAdvisor, of course).Upon arriving at the airport (Narita), we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there, right across the street from the hotel. Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo, but that's a 5 minute train ride, with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3~5.About the hotel it is huge, with many options for food and entertainment, I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses. Depending on which tower you stay in (Main Tower was great), the rooms are new, but a bit small, with everything needed in a hotel, including a small fridge (bring your snacks and water).Very clean, nothing to say about that, except that some floors smelled like cigarretts. Internet is paid (about US$10.00) and it is wired, so bring your wireless router (Apple makes a great pocket-sized one).There's a convenience store downstairs, that over charges everything, but when needed it's there.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Such a cool place Great hotel, very modern. The room was very comfortable with a great shower (dual shower heads!! loved it). Wonderful view from the 27th floor and totally silent at night.

Best Hotel in San Francisco I am a huge traveler and the Argonaut Hotel was the best I have everbeen too. Not once did I have to open the door myself. Not once did I experience an unhappy employee.

Superb, comfortable stay The hotel was to an excellent standard and very friendly staff. Its an excellent base for sightseeing in London, with The Tower of London only 5 minutes walk away and the Tower Hill tube station on the circle line closer still. We didn't have breakfast in the restaurant but we had drinks in the very swish bar. Overall, excellent and I would recomment it to anyone wanting to stay in London.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

Nice Hotel - not sure of the location The Hotel was really very nice - decor was a little weird but the room was very comfortable. The beds are awesome.

Don't believe anything you read or half of what your hear We recently came back from this resort. It is advertised on the Sol Melia website as being fully renovated, which it hasn't been touched in eight years and is in need of a complete overhaul. The food is mediocure at best, 11 restaurants, only three or four open each night, beach chairs moldy and streached out, dirty beach, mildewed rooms, worn fabrics and furniture in rooms, mini bar not stocked or cold, disagreeable staff, bad service and bugs in the rooms. AA Vacations website states this is a five star property. We would rate it -5 stars. Royal Service is a joke, don't dare pay extra for it, you will be sorry, extra money for nothing, and don't drink the water.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Not bad but could be better, even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations -- really quite nice, but the room itself was fairly spartan. It did have a little sitting area, with two chairs and a table, but the beds were rock hard (you want to ease down on them gently, lest you break a body part). The air conditioning was non-operative during our very warm stay in early-mid May (the screenless window opened, however), the TV remote control did not work, although there was an attempt to repair it, and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced -- and was, with one that smelled somewhat less musty. On the positive side, the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful, the public areas and the rooms were immaculate, the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient, if not particularly appealing. 聽聽####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
Nice, Basic Hotel with Great Location This is a basic little place, nothing too flashy. We splurged a little on a superior double room, and had a good-sized room with a balcony overlooking the plaza in front. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room itself was clean and perfectly fine. And, the location is pretty hard to beat - just a block from the Plaza Mayor, close to the bars and restaurants, not far from a Metro stop. I would definitely stay there again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
great location but thats about it. My husband and I have jusy returned from a four night stay in the Byrant hotel ,we chose it after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor. The location is fantastic and the rooms are well laid out very well serviced etc. I would not reccomend this hotel because of the snooty attitute of quite a few of the staff which made it very uncomfortable, it was not a hotel to relax in just one to be seen in if you were of a certain age and dressed in a certain manner.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]

bad to be true i stayed 1 night on january 1, first we were assigned a room that had not been cleaned (at 6 in the afternoon) we were given another room but this one had no water, this resolved we had no hot water (we were told by other guests that this problem was 4 days old) we were imformed that this problem was outside the hotel. At 10.:30 we went to the lounge area and the receptionist practicly kiked us away closing the tv and telling us we could not stay there. The room although modern were filled with defects, like electric cables hanging.

Totally gorgeous From start to finish our stay at the New York Palace was perfect. Before going we emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room with a view and we most definitely got one.

Yawn, it's another Hilton It's a Hilton. If you've stayed in one before, you know what you're going to get. Soul-less luxury, well-trained but passionless staff, a feeling of anonymity. If you're paying for yourself (as opposed to business expenses), it's probably not worth the money. Only point where the Hilton Barcelona is above average is the decor, which looks modern and a little more characterful than the average 1970's brown and bronze, chandeliers and marble that most Hiltons seem to display.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral']]

Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
