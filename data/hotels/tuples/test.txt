Don't Believe the Reviews - Read This First "The Terror of Tinytown" The staff is fine but the rooms here are so small as to defy belief. I booked my room based on the positive reviews but after I checked in I began to question who these people were that wrote these great things. If you want to rent a room so small that you can't even open your luggage except on your bed, you've found the right place.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Fabulous room and views! You definitely get what you pay for here. We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment with harbour views. The room was absolutely fantastic, very spacious, beautiful bathroom and fully equipped with everything you need. The view was great as well, which was expected considering the brillant location right on the harbour. We stayed here for one night after staying at another hotel for a week and though twice the price, it was 3 times as good!####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great place to stay in Paris My friend stayed in this hotel seven years ago and had recommended it to me, and I was not disappointed during my stay there this spring. I found the place very clean, friendly, and in great location. Christine was very helpfull and very patient with all the questions we had as the first time travelers to Paris with absolutly no knowledge of French. If you're looking for a good place for a decent price, this hotel would be an excellent choice! Ask for the off street room.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Fabulous Boutique Hotel A hotel that does what it is supposed to do. We had a wonderful suite with a comfortable bed and good climate control. The staff from the doorman to the floor maid and from the front desk to the shift manager were most accommodating and professional. There is a continental buffet breakfast in the lobby daily and a wine reception in the evening, both complimentary. The internet connection is free and works perfectly.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
Good value and Great breakfast Stayed there for 4 nights in mid-Sep. The room was small and facilities were basic. However, its location was unbeatable - reachable by all kinds of public transportation. Breakfast was impressive when compared to many 4-5 star hotels in Europe.

Great Breakfast Stayed at the Catalonia Aragon for 3 nights last month (November 2005). Clean, stylish rooms. Front Desk was extremely helpful with our lost luggage problem.

Wonderful Place to stay in Madrid We booked this hotel due to its central location and Trip Advisor ratings and weren't disappointed. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were excellent and we ate a nice dinner one night in their restaurant when we were too tired to go back out. The bathroom was huge and the price was reasonable--nice contrasts with Barcelona. The room itself was adequate. There are lots of great restaurants and tapas bars in Madrid but be sure to try La Casa del Abuelo (Near Puerto del Sol) for shrimp with garlic.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
As Per Great Reviews I booked this hotel on the basis of the consistantly good reviews given to it via Trip Advisor. The best thing about the hotel is the honesty and integrity of the staff which I have found lacking in some Venetian Hotels. I suppose this is understandable with the huge number of tourists there. It was very clean, quiet, the staff appear to enjoy their job and your presence and very good value for money. I will stay here again if I get the opportunity.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Loved the Apex City Of London Hotel Booked the Apex City of London Hotel for 2 nights based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. This is the nicest hotel I've stayed in in London to date. The best points of this hotel are the staff, the rooms and the proximity to the tube station. The staff in this hotel were more than helpfull with all our requests. I will be staying here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Great place to stay! My husband and I had been to New Orleans on two previous occasions-for the French Quarter Festival and for Mardi Gras just prior to Katrina. Even with remodeling going on, our stay at the Bienville House was wonderful! Our room was large, decorated with period furnishings/antiques and the bed was the most comfortable we have had at any hotel. The hotel was just as the pictures on the websites showed, the staff was friendly and helpful and even though the Heritage Cafe and Gamay Bistro were not open as the websites said, we had a wonderful stay at the Bienville House. We have already recommended to our friends who will be going to the Jazz Fest to check out the Bienville House for a great time.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Most awful hotel we ever stayed at My husband and I stayed at the Raphael in May 04. The rooms were not that great for the amount we payed, and the staff was not friendly. We also got really bad food poisoning from their room service and we both were extremely sick. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!!!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Decent package deal Hotel room was decent for the price paid for. It did show some age in the walls and furniture but serves the purpose for a place to stay. Small kichenette was useful for the fridge and microwave. Should always prefer a double over a single king size bed since the room is so much more! Conveniently across from the international market and walking distance to the beach. Also has complimentary trolley to the mall.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great hotel in a Great Location Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in early August. The hotel staff was very helpful, the rooms were clean and although I do not speak any french, I had no problems at all. Very convienant to the Eiffel Tower (5 min walk). Nice choice of small cafe's and shops in the area. Skip the pricey breakfast and walk to a nearby shop instead.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Good room and location We only had one night in Florence, so I chose this place for its good proximity to tourist sites and train station and based on the excellent reviews it received here. The hotel was easy to find, and our room turned out to be quite nice. Air conditioning worked as advertised and cooled the room well at all hours. Furnishings were quite functional, and we got to see our first bidet in this first stop in Italy. Front desk staff was quite helpful, and the included breakfast was good but simple continental fare.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Worst hotel ever!!!!!! This was the worst place I have ever stayed. The bathroom smelled so badly like mold that we could not open the door without the entire room smelling. Also the room was just dirty. The best way for me to tell you how bad this hotel was is to let you know that I joined this site simply to make sure no one else has to stay here.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Clean and Good Location I stayed here for a weekend by myself (single female) and was happy with the service and the rooms. It is a budget hotel but was clean and comfortable and would happily stay here again. It was close to trams and trains.

Horrific I had booked a room for 3 days this past February, and after reading some of the reviews here, I cancelled it. Thank goodness because when I saw it as I drove by on the highway, it looked pretty terrible. I should have been better about writing down all of the cancellation info, because a month later, they charged me for the room I didn't even stay in, and refuse to refund my money. Don't stay there - save yourself a headache. There are plenty of other affordable places to stay in San Juan without having to experience the unprofessionalism of this awful place.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Smart Hotel, good location The hotel is in both a quiet and central location; 2 steps from the Vondelpark and 2 minutes from Leidersplein. The public areas are smart and modern and the rooms functional, clean but a bit small. We travelled with a baby and though a very clean and comfortable cot was waiting for him in our room, the lack of space and facilities like a kettle made things a bit difficult. The staff were all helpful and friendly and overall I would recommend it as a good city hotel, but perhaps more suited to singles / couples than families.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Amazing Wedding Night! I stayed at the Alexis Hotel the night before my wedding and the night of my wedding in the Honeymoon Suite. It was the perfect place to get ready for the big day with my bridesmaids. The staff took excellent care of every need we had (which was plenty due to 7 ladies getting ready!). The room was immaculate when my husband and I arrived after the wedding. We had a lovely experience and would highly recommend the Alexis Hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

OK hotel, Great Location This is a 2 star hotel (maybe??) with an excellent location. The rooms are on the shabby side - old paint, outdated upholstery, chipped furniture. But the location cannot be beat - steps from the entrance to Chinatown and a short walk to Union Square. And while the room was on the shabby side, it was clean!!!You can't beat the price, especially for the location.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

loved this place My girlfriends i stayed here for a week, We had the best time ever. Everyone there was very courtious with an exception of the unhappy young front desk girl but Orlando down on the beach made up for that. Our room was good sized and our room looked out to the beach. The only downfall to this getaway was when it was time to take a Taxi back to the airport. I highly recommend this place to others and highly anticipate my oppurtunity to go again in December.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Great quality for the budget minded traveller We were budget conscious when booking the hotel and its services far exceeded my expectations. Its location was fantastic, close to all the attractions, and transport via the Metro is literally 30sec away. We had a quiet room (unbelievable in NY) and although the bed was a lilttle bit on the small side, we had a comfortable rest. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting decent accomodation in NY but don't want to pay the higher prices of the hotel chains.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'neutral']]

Nice Airport Hotel Very nice overnight stay at the Steigenberger. I was in the Executive Tower, with a very nice room, comfortable bed and great shower. Breakfast was about average for a hotel like this. The free shuttle to Frankfurt Airport runs 24 hrs a day and takes less than 10 minutes, making it easy to get on the S-Bahn to go to either downtown Mainz or Frankfurt or a variety of other locations. This is definitly a good value for an airport hotel. It's not as convienient as a hotel that is actually in the airport, but the location off site makes it nice and quiet - the rooms are extremely well insulated.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]
5 stars without the fussing The apartment was as nice as a five star hotel, but with a fully equiped kitchen and at a tenth of the price. We paid 拢40 a night for 4 nights and basicly we couldn't believe our luck. Nice lounge, comfy bed, big bathroom. Balcony. It is about a 15 minute bus ride away from the CBD, but the value for money makes up for it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]

Nothing to write home about We've stayed in many Hiltons and this one is at the bottom of our list. The lobby is pretty nice, but the rooms and hallways are dated. The hallway to our room was dark and dingy, with stained carpeting. The furnishings in the room were fairly clean and in decent condition, although everything appeared to be in need of an overhaul, especially the bathroom. This property definitely did not meet the standards of the other four diamond Hiltons that we have stayed in (not really sure why it is a four diamond).####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral']]

Perfect Location, friendly staff, very plesant stay! I stayed there in late jan 2005 as a single traveller, got a great deal of 85 euro per night, and upon arrival, got upgraded into a double room! The room was at the back corner of the building, very spacious, and the state of the bathroom impressed me. Yes, it may not look like your average 4 star hotel, but the staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect!! Makes it very easy for me to walk out to the Dam Square at mid-night just to take pictures of the snow!I would definetly stay there again when I return to Amsterdam.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Terrible Service I was guaranteed one price for a room and they ended up booking me for an entire other room type and when trying to get it switched to the correct room, would not honor their price I was quoted only 4 hours before.

A Quality Hotel in a Perfect Location ! The Ramada City Centre is a quality hotel that offers all of the services and facilities that are expected from a hotel under the ownership of a major company. The rooms are of a reasonable size with standard tv, radio, telephone, fan, safe, trouser press and tea and coffee making facilites. I stayed for 4 nights and am pleased to report that the room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were also provided daily. The hotel had an impressive large 24 hour reception area, lounge, restaurant and bar, all appeared to be recently renovated/decorated. Within walking distance are Central Station, the main shopping streets and the Red Light District, the trams also stop directly in front of the hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

It was fine! I stayed there for 2 nights on Jan 1st 2nd.the hotel was fully booked for regular rooms, so when i checked in i was upgraded to an executive floor, just for the room, not for the service.the hotel is just above a big shopping center with ok food, and a subway station which isn't the most convenient, but it will do.the room was clean, the service was ok, but definitely not something to write about either way, if you need a good hotel in HK, and Mongkok is your region take it, but only if they give a good price, i wanted to extend my stay but they gave me a ridiculous offer so I switched hotels.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great location, but needs an update My husband and I spent one night at this hotel before flying out early the next morning. For what we needed this hotel served its purpose--it was close to the train station, which we wanted since we were arriving by train, we didn't need breakfast since we were leaving so early, we were able to book one night only (through Expedia) despite the fact that it was a weekend, and the front desk was manned 24 hours so they were able to check us out when we left and they got us a cab. The hotel could use some freshening up, and I agree that it's not four-star quality. However, the location can't be beat and some of the views are amazing.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great location  Location was excellent. This hotel is very grand at reception and ground level. However rooms in older part of hotel need updating. We stayed on the 10th floor but were accompanied by renovations taking place in a room on that floor from 7.30am on 2 mornings! Not acceptable and informed manager who was very apologetic etc. My warning with this hotel is don't make any calls from the phone in your room as you will be very upset when you view your bill on checking out.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities prices', 'negative']]

Restaurant Hotel is very nice. Restaurant is overpriced and the food is way below average. The manager Alex is way too arrogant and thinks he is doing you a favor for this very mediocre restaurant. Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen's on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience. Although hotel and roof top is a very nice amenity defintely stay away from their restaurant and their very arrogant mangager Alex.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
Location Location Location We stayed the night of the 18th May at the hotel in a dbl upgraded room, although as the previous correspondent said ,it didnt have a walk in shower, but the bathroom was lovely nonetheless. A very nice hotel, attentive staff - but expensive drinks. However, when you balance that with a very competitive 拢20.00 3 course price fixe menu it balances out. Breakfasts are also quite expensive, but we chose to eat a 100 meteres up the road at Marios, all inclusive for around a fiver, and very nice - allbeit not as grand as the Sofitel.

Excellent Hostal  Hostal Adriano/Adria has an excellent location - basically in the heart of Madrid. Very well decorated rooms with little balconies to let in some fresh air (or smoke). A lot of space, blowdryers, safes in room, refrigerator in room, and plenty of soap/shampoo. Noise wasn't a problem for us and the staff was typical stiff Spanish professionalism. I was impressed with the rooms given the great location and low cost - definitely a treasure we found and can't wait to stay there again!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great Location, Dirty rooms After changing our room 3 times we finally got a half decent room. I would suggest asking to see a few rooms once you arrive. The hotel saff was very nice and they had a decent breakfast in a beautiful room. We found the location to be great, but would not stay in this hotel again due to the cleanless. The hotel is over 500 years old and it seemed like they have not changed the bed linenes and matresses for over 200 years. Everything seemed dirty.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative']]
On the whole....fab I have to say that most of the reviews are spot on. IT IS a lovely little hotel, great value, great location, nice staff, and I would without a doubt stay there again. They are a couple of things that others have mentioned which are also true, thin walls (felt like someone else was in the room) and it was a bit of a tight squeeze around the bed, but that was it. I had friends staying in one of the suites and that was great, so if you want a bit more of a treat for an extra 30 euros book one of those.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Great Location, clean and reasonable Two of us stayed here at the Hotel Plaza Mayor just when they were completing some exterior renovations. The rooms are small, clean withprivate baths. Get a room off the front of the hotel and higher up toaviod street noise. Very close to everything, Puerta del Sol and latenight activities and snacks.

Highly recommended We stayed in the Lorenzo Il Magnifico for 3 nights in August 2004. The standard of the accommodation was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful - to the extent that they sent out for a takeaway pizza on our behalf when my wife was feeling unwell. Considering that accommodation in Florence can be expensive we felt that the hotel represented very good value for money. The location is in a quiet part of town but is within easy reach of the city centre by public transport. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

hing special Stayed in a $400 per night suite this weekend in SF and was very dissapointed. Room was small and there were stains in the drapes, carpet and duvet. Ran out of toilet paper in the middle of the night and the tissue box was also empty! The spa tub was cracked and the glass shower door came off while in the shower! It was noisy and the view room overlooked the wallgreens and yelling steet people. I'll never go back.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Had a great stay! We just stayed at the Astor Crowne Plaza for a conference and had a great stay. The hotel is in a wonderful location and was close to everything.

The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great hotel! We stayed at the Argonaut for 3 nights and thought it was a great hotel. The rooms were nice, well equipped and very clean.

Fantastic location! We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Alicia. Didn't experience any of the previous reviewer's problems.

Would definately recommend this hotel!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Excellent location but need some renovations The only good thing about this hotel is its excellent location. It is 10 minutes walking from the Rocks, the harbourfront and many other attractions in Sydney. Overall the hotel, outside and inside, has a kind of run down appearance. The room was OK but the bathroom was kind of obsolete, with very old and loose faucets and it did not look very clean.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]

Great Time at the Marriott Marquis First time staying at a hotel in NYC, excellent location. First time booking a hotel not using its own website and I must say we got a GREAT deal for the Memorial Weekend. Staff was very nice to all of us.

Excellent service, location and room The hotel's location can not be beat. It is withing walking distance of Times Square, Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue and so much more. Service was simply excellent, prompt valet service, great concierge, helpful staff, excellent breakfast. The room was the largest I have ever had in NY, very well appointed and super clean.

Great locale and Service, a bit tattered Stayed here two nights in april visiting family etc. What the hotel may lack in modern it makes up for in fabulous staff, free sodas and chips, wonderful continental breakfast with home made baked goods, and spacious rooms. Speaking of the rooms - they are very dated - the furniture in living room was coming apart, the drawers in the dresser of our bedroom had no tracks and the sink in bathroom was mildewed. It's in need of an uplift but met our needs and the weather around poolside was fabulous.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Bad service I was deeply disappointed in their service. I was promised a specifichotel room and when I arrived, they said they did not have those types of rooms at their hotel. The confirmation sent by the Marriot stated that I would be given the room promised. No attempts were madeby the hotel to fix the situatuion.####[['service general', 'negative']]
Entertainment team I visited Excellence Punta Cana DR, and I must comment on how great this resort is. The accomadations, amedities, food and most of all the entertainment, made this resort a return vacation in the future. I enjoyed all of the activities such as dancing, spanish lessons, aqua arobics, volleyball, and so much more. I don't think any of these activities would be possible with out the excellent entertainment staff, who went out of their way to say hello, include you in the activities, and just plain make it fun. It was was like the real life version of Dirty Dancing- minus the drama. Thank you Mariel, Eliza and Jaun Carlo, just to name a few.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Nice hotel My family of three just returned from 6 great days in Berlin. We stayed at Hotel Agon Opera.

November 05 at the Westin Stayed two nights in Nov. 05. Room was very nice with Simmons Beautyrest bed that was very comfortable, nice big TV, good bathroom and towels. Only problems were that the safe was locked upon arrival and the maid took the robe on the 2nd night and didn't replace it. Mini bar as usual was very expensive and the place overcharges for things like the heath center and internet.

xactly on the button just a short one this time....went to Barcelona on June 8 and stayed in the Caledonian. All in all nice hotel, the rooms are great, spotless, well stocked, and mine anyway would have had excellent wheelchair access, the reception and staff are helpful and the breakfast was simple, but tasty and filling. The hotel is supposedly 3 star but could do with a 4 star rating.... it is that nice. All in all, with its added locality to ' Las Ramblas ' would pound for pound, be hard to beat.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Excellent hotel, excellent location Just on the site of the former Wall, this Hotel is a perfect jumping off point for everything to see and do in Berlin. Starbucks on block, train on corner. Our junior suite, while not luxuruous on the Four Seasons level, was extremely clean, comfortable and spacious. The Exec lounge is worth it for the extras---food and beverages and papers and internet and more. Staff wonderfully helpful.

A Return Visit that did not disappoint Following our visit in October 2005 for a stop over, we used the Langham Place as our base for an extended visit to Hong Kong. Just at the end of the Chinese New Year, the atmosphere was great. This time we stayed in a Club Room and use of the Club Lounge. A nice touch was the complimentary desert from the hotel management on the occaision of my wife's 40th birthday. The location was perfect for access to all parts of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Terrotries - through the MTR and a Hong Kong Octopus Card.####[['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['polarity positive', 'positive']]

great Don't believe whqat you read..... The King George is a fine hotel. Very close to Union Square (2 min walk) and right in the heart of the action. We stayed for 5 days and really liked it. The rooms aren't huge, but who stays in their hotel room all day in San Fran anyway???2 suggestions...ask for a first floor room as the elevator is very slow...get a room in the centre of the hotel.. no view but cuts out the noise as SF is very loud at night.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Good location, but get an inside room The Moore is an old place in a good section of downtown, between Seattle Center  Pike Place Market. Our first room was on the street  was a bit noisy (there's no A/C, so we had the windows open). We switched the next night to a courtyard room, but you still get some reflected traffic noise. The courtyard rooms surround the Moore Theater, so you might not want to stay there on a concert night (unless you don't go to bed early). I'd still prefer this over the budget hotels near Seattle Center.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Mislead in cost of internet access I stayed here for three nights the last week of December. It is a good hotel in a good location but:-The hotel's web site implies that internet access is free but that isn't so; they charge $9.95/day regardless of whether you use the provided ethernet cable or wi-fi (aT-mobile service). I used the ethernet cable, but the process of authorizing the charge each day took about five minutes (the system is very slow).-Valet parking costs $31/day.-The restaurant (Cafe 15) had very slow service when I eat there, even though they weren't doing much business.####[['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Rust, mold and cold water While the refurbished lobby, restaurants and bars are still elegant and luxurious, the standard rooms are far more reminiscent of a decrepit dorm room. Chipped paint, rusting fixtures, moldy grout and an utter lack of amenities. The assorted selections of soaps and shampoos, apparently borrowed from other hotels, is not critical, but is indicative of the curent state of the Biltmore. Waking up to find a mixture of cold to luke warm water dribbling out of the five foot high showerhead only reinforced an already negative impression. The staff are certainly accomodating and room service was adequate, but I would wait until a complete renovation of the rooms before ever staying at the Biltmore again.####[['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

good value for the money I stayed at the hotel before when it was the Alisa. I got this room off of Priceline. The hotel appears to have renovated its rooms, including the bathrooms. While I was a little nervous from my previous trip to the Alisa, I was pleasantly suprised. Not that this is the Ritz-Carlton, but my room had a mini-fridge and microwave, with a bathtub and shower curtain around it.

Friendly I stayed in the Friendship hotel with my wife on our first trip to China. Having read numerous guides warning me to wear flip-flops in th shower, etc, I was expecting a very basic hotel, however the Friendship Hotel is anything but. The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable (though my wife found the beds a little hard), the staff were friendly and spoke enough English to deal with any problems we had. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Beijing.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Good location - otherwise horrible I got the hotel because it was in a good location and the reviews looked plausibly ok however I was very dissapointed. It was in a good location, right next to Chinatown, but it should not be called a hotel, but a cheap motel or a hovel. The room may have been cleaned before we got there, but it was so old that you couldn't tell for sure. Furniture, carpet, bathroom all in horrible condition. Even though it was cheap ~$75/night, it really wasn't worth it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'conflict']]

Not bad at all I stayed at the Grant in 1998 and was fairly impressed enough to come back again in 2007. The rooms near the street were refurbished a couple of years ago, so I requested a room there. It's not as noisy as I thought. The room is pretty clean, especially the bathroom. It's a great no-frills place to stay that is central to many of the sights in S.F.

"Above Average" Stayed here only for 1 night, coming from Australia on a stopover to the UK we were happy with the stay! Probably wouldn't go back again - it was above average but only a typical business stop-over hotel.

Uncomfortable Beds! The hotel has a convenient location but it ends there. Concierge were not too helpful getting us a taxi...which was took ages to arrive even if you book in advance. The room was nice but the beds were too soft it was so uncomfortable. You will not get a good night's sleep here.####[['room_amenities comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Most comfortable beds ever! The hotel was very beautiful and the service was impeccable. The rooms were relatively spacious for being in downtown San Fran. Most of all though, the beds were like sleeping on a cloud. They were extremely comfortable so much so that I almost over slept and missed my seminar. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel.####[['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Location, Location, Location We enjoyed a 3 day stay at the Parc 55! The location is the best because of the proximity to BART (across the street), and the cable cars (1 block away). Westfield Shopping Center is located directly across the street (Nordstroms, Bloomingdale, great food court too).The service and the rooms were excellent and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco that would like to be close to the shopping and public transportation. It is right on Market Street, and is close to Chinatown. Parking is a little pricey at $40 for overnight; however, parking is at a premium at this location. We found great rates for this hotel on Expedia; however, I would recommend that you check out their website (Parc 55) first because they have several special package rates.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great Location My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and had a great stay. The hotel has a great location, is easy to get to from the airport (trainstraight from CDG stops about 300 metres from the hotel), the rooms clean and the staff very helpful. Only downside was that the rooms were small, but you did have enough room to move around and you can鈥檛expect much more from a hotel of this price in the city centr####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict']]
Excellent in all areas. We stayed at the Lenox for 4 nights and were treated like special guest through out our stay. The room was spacious and elegant and their committment to the environment was impressive. There was a filtered water access in the hall so need for buying bottled water. It was a special occasion and when they found out they sent wine and cheese to our room. I will definitely stay there the next time I return to Boston.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral']]
Hotel Nadia Hotel Nadia is lovely - the staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean (as a family, we had the 'quad' which was a bit of a squeeze but the beds were very comfortable and plenty of cupboard space). The steep stairs might put some people off. The dining room is also small and tables were not always available for breakfast. Also the central location meant that traffic noise (and church chimes!) were noticeable. But walking distance of many places and right near Ann Frank Museum. Would stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'conflict']]
Beautiful Hotel and Great Staff! I booked a one night stay here for my mother and I but accidently booked the room for the wrong date. The front staff did not even wince or balk at my silly error even though the hotel was just about full to capacity. The person helping me calmly went into the backroom and was gone for perhaps 5 minutes and found a beautiful room for us. I was stressed initially but his calmness and great customer service put me at ease. I will never forget the great service I received at this hotel with the staff exhibiting no condescension whatsover.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Hotel in a central location Stayed here for four days in July. A five minute walk, around the corner and down the hill and you are at Union Square, perfect for shopping and picking up tour buses. Very clean and well maintained. Would stay here agai####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Wonderful location We stayed at the Hotel Bigallo on the recommendation of a friend, and were not disappointed. It was an easy walk from the train station, even with our luggage, and a great location (the windows opened up to a very close view of the Duomo). It was an easy walk to everything in Florence. The room was spacious and attractive, and the breakfast OK. It was noisy outside, even at night (just shut the windows for quiet). There was an computer in the lobby you could pay to use for email, etc.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'neutral']]
What a gem We stayed at this hotel for eight nights in July and it met all our needs and more. Friends told us that hotel rooms in Paris are small so we booked a Millenium room which is larger. It met all our needs - clean, comfortable beds and pillows, air conditioned, very nice bathroom and very friendly multi lingual staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to stay in Saint Germain de Pres.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Good hotel, outside city center Large hotel outside city center (15 min walk) on the river Arno. We had a larger room for European standards, but the bathroom was very small and the shower was really small. We did not have breakfast in this hotel, but we did have dinner in one of their restaurants. It was a very quiet night, but service was still slow. They have paid Internet access in their lobby.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
wonderfull Wonderfull place, much like the marriot on phuket. Of course its a big place, not smal and intimate, but even though very nice, much of it because of the pool area who is vinding about in the garden, The beach is nice too. Delicius rooms, flatscreen tv, nice bath rooms, but tub and shower in one, with very high ends, so you almost have to climb, not that easy. The pool/pools is lovely, and there ig a very high level of service everywhere. Beautyfull lobby area, and a nice spa.

A great location (especially for new years eve!) Just got back from a New Years Eve trip. The location of the hotel is perfect and you don't have to stand for hours in the crowds to watch the ball drop as there is a space made available for the hotel clients at 11.30 pm! The location is also good for all the sightseeing and shopping. The hotel itself is okay - the rooms are expensive for what they are but hey it seems that New York hotels are expensive for something half decent!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]
fantastic, love this hotel I have stayed at the Hughendon Hotel every year for the past 8 years and wouldn't stay anywhere else, it is like a home away from home. The character of the place is unique and enchanting with its artwork, antiques and friendly atmosphere. The hotel is in a wonderful location, within walking distance to all the best shops and galleries. The staff are always helpful and friendly and nothing is ever too much trouble. Victor, the piano man is another highlight. I cannot say enough good things about this place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
wish i was there now We went on a girls vacation... The hotel was everything we needed! The staff was super friendly, food just fine, beach was wonderful and plenty to do and drink... if i had one complaint it would be the beds were not the best- but just drink more and than they were great! I think it is a better place for partying with friends than a romantic gateaway...####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Excellent location, basic but clean and comfortable I stayed at this hotel mainly because of it's location and wasn't disapointed. It's got a fantastic position in the heart of the gothic quarter a few minutes from the Ramblas, plaza Catalunya and the port. The room was small and functional but very clean. The hotel was very busy and the breakfast was good. I would stay there again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Good Place, Bad Service Nice hotel, really clean, very near the train station, stores everywhere. Service is terrible, though! Their keycards get quite defective. I visited the concierge only to have this man rudely point me to the reception desk with this impossibly long line of people checking in. When I complained that I am already a guest, he glared at me and spat out What do you want me to do?!. HORRIBLE SERVICE!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
ute hotel, some construction, but comfortable and great value! The boyfriend and i stayed in this unique place due to him being in Seattle for business. It was a great location due to it being a bit off the beaten path from the business of the city yet close enough to walk everywhere I wanted to go. The rooms are incredibly large and for the price that we paid, we felt that we got a great bang for our buck! The comforter on the bed was really scratchy, and the front entrance to the hotel was under contstruction, but other than that, I would definitely reccomend this place to my friends and other travelers.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'negative']]

uldn't wait to leave I've usually found the Marriotts to be fairly good, but this one was disappointing and just a notch above a Travel Inn. Location was ok, but not central, as it was a good 15-minute walk to Dam Square and the Centraal Station. The hotel had absolutely no character whatsoever; the lobby was uninviting; and the food in both the breakfast and the bar restaurants was only just ok. The room was a good size, and the furnishings looked relatively new and comfortable, but there was a strong drainage smell in the bathroom all the time, and there was a fizzing electrical sound all through the night, which only went away when it was drowned out by the loud air con. When I mentioned this to the reception staff at check-out, they weren't interested and didn't even comment. Only go if you get a very cheap rate as you can get this sort of mediocrity anywhere.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
My second home I was welcomed again very friendly and warm. They gave me the feeling being at home. Nadia is a very nice and familial hotel, they fulfilled all my wishes, helped and gave very good hints of Amsterdam. My next stay in Amsterdam is for sure again at Nadia Hotel.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great little place Good quality and value hotel. Rooms are clean and attractive for the price, and the bathrooms are very good. Breakfast buffet is value for money and good too! As it's near to the train station the area is just 'average' but it's a close walk to all the things you want to see so it's really not a problem. Overall, very good and would stay there again.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
