Loved it! Very cozy Great hotel, with a nice relaxed atmosphere. After a long cold day in the city it was so nice to sit by the big fireplace, order a drink, and watch the boats go by. Rooms aren't huge, but very cozy.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict']]
Never stay here! Whew, this place was bad. The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn't let my kids in it, the whole place smelled, and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments. I was literally scared of this place, and when I reported it to the desk, they just said they couldn't stop the calls because they were coming from within the building. Sounds like the beginning of a teen horror movie, doesn't it?####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Perfect Stay Excellent hotel! Great location, friendly staff. Rooms were clean and decently sized with fun decor. Quiet too- even being in the center of everything.

Great Stay Wondeful hotel in Florence! A little out of the way (but still can walk to everything in 10 minutes or less). Front desk was great - had to check out very early so when I called for a wake-up call, the operate ordered a cab for me to arrive at a certain time and they packed a breakfast for me (because I'd miss the free breakfast). Room was very comfortable and a good size. Will always stay here in the future!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Excellent Choice for Business Traveler, Tourists A very nice hotel. Good amenities (ice tea and snacks in the afternoon, free breakfast in the morning, coffemaker, microwave, fridge in room). If you are a jogger, this is an excellent location - run down St. Charles for a few miles in the former trolley tracks or drive a few blocks to Audubon Park and run the loop there. Close to nice restaurants and a large Whole Foods on Magazine Street. A great value too. I will definitely stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
great hotel Just returned from this hotel - great staff, funky rooms, good location. We didn't find it noisy at all. Rooftop pool small but nicely done. We will return and advise others to go.

Gran Ronda Good Location The Gran Ronda is well placed, it 's on a road that runs parallel to La Rambla. You can walk to the North end off La Rambla via a well lit side street within 10 mins. The breakfasts are superb with a wide choice of both continental and English style food. The rooms are well appointed and very clean.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great Hotel Have just returned from a weekend away march 4 - 7th. Our room was on the 37th floor and we had great views of the Empire State building and the river. The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. Location is excellent and only a few minutes from the heart of Time Square. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved it - would definatly stay again. We really liked this hotel. Good room, great restaurants nearby and good cocktails in the bar, not far from Old Street station. We have had roadside rooms in other london hotels which have been very noisy. Because of the good double glazing this is not a problem at the Hoxton. The place is clean stylish and if you get a room deal great value for money.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
Enjoyed our stay! We stayed here for a week while our daughter played soccer in the area and found this hotel modern, clean and the staff very helpful. There is a 10 min walk to Central Station, but a tram stops right out side the hotel. We booked through Expedia at around $120/day which I thought was a decent value. All in all we really enjoyed our experience here.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

worth the price! We stayed at the Ritz Millenia for 5 days in Sep 06. Their staff were super friendly - and made all the arrangements we asked for. The location is perfect for evening walks by the river, with all the restaurants nearby. The bathroom was the highlight of the accomodations - we had the river view which was spectacular. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone!One downside: the room service breakfast options are limited, you are better off walking to a cafe nearby.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Wonderful Stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Brentwood Inn. The room was comfortable, clean, and tastefully furnished with great attention to detail. The location was terrific - within walking distance to wonderful restaurants and convenient to the freeway. Free internet access , complimentary breakfast, and bottled water to start the day were great , too.

So comfortable! 15th July, 2006This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Great Hotel Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of August and I have to say it was fab. From the moment we arrived every member of staff we came into contact with was friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. The room was lovely, nice decor and extremely clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit San Francisco.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

clean but small rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, but very tiny and dated interiors. elevators are small and slow. location is ideal for shopping in union square area. would stay again, but would try to get a better price. parking is very expensive and tax is added to parking fee. overall average rating is about all this deserved.####[['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii. It was definitely impressive, though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare. Still, it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos. My hotel room had what I'd call a partial ocean view, you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view. I was suprised at how noisy the street below me was, even on the 26th floor, I heard even car horn, every screaming baby, every yelling partier on the street, all night long.####[['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]

BE Careful Hotel was OK, had problem with room, lack of water (Hot  Cold) also had small ant infestation. Hotel opened up resources to outsiders on weekends, so you spent your time waiting to be served or dodging children in pools. Also observed staff taking cutlery from one dining table which just finished and placing it on another, not too hygenic, made sure to wash utensils before using. Hotel and staff very pleasant. Hotel was rated when I went as a 4 Star, to me it is 2 Star at best.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative']]
5 star hotel with historic charm Stayed for one night and was really impressed. We stayed in a historic room which was lovely - bathroom on the left as you entered and then a small staircase leading into the spacious main room. Thought the ultra high beds were cool. The historic building is charmingly converted. Overall, would highly recommend it.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Over rated For the price you pay, make sure you get one of the better rooms. When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade (basically all the cars going up can see you). I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later, I got the one I wanted, with a bit of a view for the same price. There's nothing extraordinary about this hotel, the gym is quaint, the rooms are small, the bathroom is actually really big, it was about 1/2 the size of the bedroom... the restaurant is pretty cool.####[['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Generic Motor Hotel Two Holiday Inn's, back-to-back: This one and the H.I. Express Seattle. Very close to the space needle and a couple of blocks to the free bus zone going downtown.

worthwhile I was surprised at how nice this hotel was, given the horrible experience I had at another hotel in Amsterdam that had the same star rating. It was really nice.

Very nice Not a lot to complain about really - inexpensive, superb location very close to station, air-conditioned rooms, lovely building and al fresco breakfast included in price! Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax, a 10% tax that everyone has to pay. Although it's possible for non-Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $300, that doesn't apply to services. You've got a great hotel guys, worth $165 per night of anyone's money, so why not be honest about your prices?####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Pros:-great location - convenient for walking places - tianamen, restaurants etc-safe-internet-nice building interiors, food, spa-courteous staff-decent priceCons:-dirty bathroom - moldy, water didn't drain in shower-smelly hallways - my entire hallway smelled of mold and cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a smoke free hallOverall: I'd stay here since this seemed to be a common theme for higher end hotels in China.

good location, but unorganised Stayed at the hotel Carlton for 1 week in october. The price was reasonable, however we stayed in 3 rooms in that week. We wanted 2 singles, but for 2 nights they were 'unavailable' so we were moved around rooms with double beds. On one occasion there was a couple at reception complaining that they had 2 single beds when they wanted a double, but we were unable to swap with them. Apart from the trouble with the rooms, the location was fantastic, only a quick walk to union square and the staff were polite and helpful.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Think the HI is getting a bad rap I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of April. My room was spotless (despite what some reviewers have written), and while the bathroom was small, the shower itself was roomy, the hotel bath linens of very good quality and a working iron and ironing board in the closet. The staff was very friendly, very helpful and willing to work with a little Spanglish if communication broke down. I, for one, like not being in a property facing Ashford (it was much quieter) and still less than a block from everything on Ashford. Breakfast every AM in a room facing the pool (which only gets sun in the AM BTW) was good with pastries, juice and coffee. All in all, more than I expected from a Holiday Inn at a reasonable prepurchase rate.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Fantastic!!!!! Went to this hotel for Valentines weekend, as soon as we arrived we were very impressed as they upgraded us for Free!. The hotel is fantastic and very clean. The staff at the hotel were always very helpful and friendly. This hotel is in a perfect location, and what better way to enjoy it than to go back for a swim and sauna at the end of a busy day. While you are in Paris I would definately recommend going for a meal along the River Seine, and also a meal in the Pavillion Elysee restaurant (along the champse elysee).When I visit Paris again I will stay here again!!!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam, but it wasn't too far from it. It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night. It was clean and comfortable, but nothing spectacular. There were a few burn marks, probably from smokers, but I guess that's to be expected in Amsterdam. The free breakfast was decent, and at least it was free, a rarity in Europe.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews, we were a bit weary about this hotel. It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop. What valuables we did have (passports, cash etc) was stored in the reception safe and always available. Staff were friendly enough, but the main attraction is this hotel's location right on the bustling las ramblas. If it's a quiet place you're after don't book here, but if it's a clean budget hotel right in the heart of things, we would absolutely recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Decent deal, decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean, has a modern Asian feel in the decour, and a decent breakfast to start you on your way. The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge. Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring. This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn't seem to know where it was. The surrounding neighbourhood seems a little run-down but perhaps this is just the old feel of the place.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Just perfect We stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in January, 2006. We arrived a full 39 hours late, due to snow in Tokyo, but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren't there.

Everything was clean, the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful - from giving us milk at 2am to help us sleep as we were jet lagged to arranging the shuttle bus to take us to Mills avenue so we could go for a night on the town!!Having toured round for two weeks the amenities and service here were not beaten along our travels - high speed internet, breakfast, pool, spa, vending machines, fridge, microwave. Would definitely recommend!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Hidden paradise in middle of the city When I make the reservation for this hotel I have no idea of the hidden paradise that I found in the middle of the city. This small hotel offers more than I expected. It has beautiful rooms with floors in marble and each bath has a jacuzzi bathtubs!! It has a enchanting patio with tropical flowers, terracota tiles and a marvlous mobiliary, a little but confortable pool and very kind personnel. Definitively I will visit this great place again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
Great Location Have now stayed here twice. The hotel represents good value for NYC and has an excellent health centre and pool. Other public areas are also impressive. Its location is spot on for sightseeing and accessing the subway. Rooms are average in size yet well appointed and are spotlessly clean. A solid choice!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Restaurant Recs The Ritz is a terrific hotel but their restaurant recommendations need updating. The consierge sent me to a so-so Sushi place called San Raku and then to an awful Chinese place called Oriental Pearl. In a city of thousands of Japanese and Chinese restaurants I think the Ritz could do better.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Enjoyed Montparnasse A most fantastic hotel to stay in Paris city. All attractions are very easily accessed by the Metro system. Relaxing, pleasent stay for young couples or older couples. Our fours day stay was very satisfactory and most affordable. The district around is very beautiful indeed.

Good Budget Hotel... Key Word = Budget Monte Carlo is clean, fairly comfortable (very firm beds) and best of all, well located. Have no qualms about booking this hotel if you're travelling on a budget (I believe we paid around $50 a night for a double room w/ no WC in high season). However, consider skipping breakfast- for 7 Euro, you could do better at a corner bakery.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]

Excellent Hotel and Location This Hotel is in a excellent location close to SF Bay and Trolley Cars with the BART station adjacent to the Hotel. Stayed at this Hotel after a terrible stay as the Westin in Market Street SF,and the differences are huge. This is a modern construction which does NOT shake,rattle and roll when its windy in SF.The Hotel's restaurants are great and breakfast is excellent with wonderful staff especially reception and dining room. Its location allows a wonderful walk to most attractions or catch the Bart. TIP.....catch the BART to SF Airport from the Hotel!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Stay here! This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms (we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious). Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly. I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars. I would have rated it higher and I'm very picky about hotel accomodations. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
Large quiet rooms with great service! I stayed for 3 days and was amazed at the size of the room. Having stayed in other NYC hotels, this is by far one of the best for the price. The kitchen was a big money saver and the staff was friendly, knowledgable and helpul. I had to day-sleep needed to change rooms due to construction - they were most gracious. Would definitely stay again.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia. The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted, but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations. Not the best news for our daughters, who were eager to swim after the flight! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door, but whilst better than nothing, this was not terribly convenient. The hotel offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd, but is showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
clean and family friendly We enjoyed our clean room and the wonderful service. We ordered room service and my two young children (4 and 6) had plenty of delicious options on the kid's menu.

Good hotel It is a good, clean, high end hotel in Beijing. Although I won't rate it as highly as it is hyped. Even service and concierage is not as great. The enjoyable part is good decoration, cleanliness, comfortable rooms, very clean and well designed bathrooms and location, location, location. Its walking distance from Wangfujing and subway station which is a big plus.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Just the job Nice little hotel this, right on top of shopping, the Ramblas and a bit of nightlife to boot. Rooftop swimming pool big enough for a cooling dip if you are there when it is warm enough and felt a bit like a scene from a spanish mary poppins looking out over the rooftops from the pool terrace. Rooms well appointed and breakfast adequate. Trying to get a drink from the hotel bar was a challenge but if you are not in a hurry you will get one. Would and probably will return.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'neutral']]
Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A'dam. A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station. We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean, attractive and had an great bathroom. The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little (not mid-forties with beard) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room (free tea/coffee/chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free)Only minor points but will be staying there again in September. Try the DutchFlyer website (Stena lines) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing. Great value and a good alternative to flying.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
WE LOVED IT. Berlin was the start of our Europe trip and the Westin was a great start to our holiday. Without doubt when in Berlin we will try to stay here again. The location is perfect (a few minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag),the heavenly beds are heavenly, the buffet breakfast is superb and the quality of the hotel far exceeded our expectations. We were there for 3 nights in February and with limited time location is so important - and this hotel was the perfect choice.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Never again On arrival, front desk informed us that we had cancelled our 7-night reservation earlier that day.

Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English. I asked for an ice machine and was almost sent down the street to a gas station because they thought I was asking for an automatic teller machine. The Cuban music at the restaurant next door started at 10 PM or so and didn't quit until after midnight. Not good if you want to catch an early flight. On the good side they did allow us to check in early and the room was clean.####[['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

"You will not be disapointed" My wife and I stayed at the Menzies Hotel for three nights recently and from the moment we stepped from the cab we were treated as if we were the only guests especially from Andrew who welcomed us.

We'll be back!RegardsDerek Coral Smith####[['service general', 'positive']]
ute hotel, but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station, the Accademia and the Duomo, however the noise at night was unbearable! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street, so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel. But if you plan to stay here, make sure you request a room in the back, away from the street (there are many). Otherwise, the reception people were very helpful and my internet-addicted boyfriend loved that there was free internet in the lobby. The room was very clean, nice bathroom, very modern accomodations.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Hotel Casci Hotel Casci is a small family run hotel in Florence, well located and convenient to the Duomo and other sites. The staff was a joy to deal with, no request was too small or too much trouble for them. Their restaurant suggestions were wonderful and their customer service was excellent. This was a our first stay in Florence and Hotel Casci was the perfect location. We spent five nights and highly recommend this hotel to future travelers.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
The Essence Music Fiasco This establishment played the staring role in the worst trip ever! It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough, but no, they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites. Lastly, in an attempt to kill the termites maybe, the hotel has electrical problems that caused a fire, landing their guests in a 鈥渟helter-like鈥?domain, that was surprisingly better compared to the Chateau Dupre.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]
Fabulous, and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel. Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city. Having spent a few hours doing the usual sightseeing, we ended up feeling that we should spend more time in the hotel enjoying its facilities (including a lovely swimming pool) and less time pounding the humid streets. It is very expensive but for a short stay, thoroughly worthwhile.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

The beds are hard!! If you don't like hard beds then this is not the place for you. The bed was like sleeping on a slab of concrete, which I suppose is OK if you like your mattress firm.

You will not be disapointed A very nice 4 star hotel. Me and my wife loved the swimming pools (especially the hot water with jakuji pool). Breakfasts were very good with lots of options.

Not for me Didn't really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities, however we knew this before checking in. The room we had was very basic, had no safe, was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel, were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed. The hotel is well situated for Market Street and Powell Street and is fine if you're looking for an economy hotel and economy it certainly is.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner, given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures, and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were, which we found to be most helpful. The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast (buffet), it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers. A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found, also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby, making the hotel very central but not noisey. We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible. A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Our worries melted away when we stepped through the door Making reservations at a hotel we had never seen gave my boyfriend and I a degree of pause. We were not sure what to expect.

Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October, our second stay there, and it was lovely. If possible, ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias. We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain, the cathedrals and the hillsides around town. The restaurant, Mark's, is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island. The hotel is a little worn in places and the breakfast was not much to be desired, but otherwise a great place to stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
Langham Stay We were supposed to have a superior room. We looked out over the roof air conditioners on the fifth floor - say you prefer not to have room 564.

Ate at Saraceno in the North End and The Four Seasons Restaurant - both fabulous.####[['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great location, not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size. I reserved directly with the hostel by email (in Spanish) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going, specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square. However, we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal, overlooking the road that was being dug up. Although they said the next day we could move rooms, they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning, which was rather annoying. Overall, it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big, new hotel. When you step in to the lobby of the hotel, it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s. Although, the modern amenities in the room and the lobby make the hotel really comfortable. Stay at the Maxwell if you want the small, boutique feel in a hotel.####[['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Fantastic Hotel! The Hotel Royal is in a brilliant location on La Rambla right in the heart of Barcelona. The staff was overly helpful and very attentive.

great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay, excellent choice, everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great, rooms little small but never in em only to sleep. Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive, find the cava bar by the port side street, cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down. In general spent a fortune its not cheap barcelona but you have to spend when there cause theres loads to do see ya next year  Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed. We knew what to expect in Venice and were happy to be near the train, the vaporetto, piazza di Roma and away from San Marco. The room was nice though not large, the bed and pillows very good and the bathroom excellent. The breakfast was varied and tasty.

I have been staying here for years. My brother and I go to New Orleans two or three time per year. We discovered the Prince Conti Hotel eight years ago, and we have been staying there ever since. The hotel is conveniently located one half block off of Bourbon Street, yet it is very quiet. As always, John, Aimee, Anne, Cindy, Eric, and Lisa take very good care of us.

I also was in and out of a few other hotels were relatives were staying, if your looking for four elevators, and a large lobby, and all the stuff that comes with a large big name hotel - you aren't going to get it at the St. Marie.

Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it. Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it's a good standard hotel it's no longer that great. Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that. Now seems full of coch parties, meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners. A real shame.####[['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great stopover We stopped over in Singapore on our way to Bali and decieded to stay at the Fullerton for our second time in 2 years.

Location, Location, Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters, this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms (new plasma TV's)at an incredibly good price. Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring. Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones, etc. but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay.

ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance/house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day.

Overall, there are many better choices and I cant understand why anyone would want to stay there.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Left after 1 night I lasted one night - the room was tiny, barely lit, musty and just unbearable.

It'll be great when it's finished! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel. We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed, the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom. Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room. The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there. Highly recommended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Wouldn't recommend it. This Hotel looks great online. Although the price is right, it doesn't make up for the cleanliness.
