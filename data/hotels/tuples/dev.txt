v nice stayed here for two nights for a wedding. Had a classic room which was small and no view, might have been disappointed if had been staying longer, but for a quick stopover it was fine. Old fashioned decor charming, bathroom small but fine, robes nice. Room service was efficient (if pricey but that is what you would expect). It just has a very nice feel and atmosphere, classy and relaxed.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance/house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day. The hotel seemed very fake and tried to be hip. The rooms were very comfortable with nice pillows and comfy bed though. Overall, there are many better choices and I cant understand why anyone would want to stay there.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive']]

Best Hotel in San Francisco I am a huge traveler and the Argonaut Hotel was the best I have everbeen too. Not once did I have to open the door myself. Not once did I experience an unhappy employee. And not once was I ever dissatisfied. From the hotel, to the employees, to the service and location, everything was top notch.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Such a cool place Great hotel, very modern. The room was very comfortable with a great shower (dual shower heads!! loved it). Wonderful view from the 27th floor and totally silent at night. The noise from the elevator was a bit annoying at first (we were right next to the elevator).####[['polarity positive', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
ute hotel, but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station, the Accademia and the Duomo, however the noise at night was unbearable! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street, so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel. But if you plan to stay here, make sure you request a room in the back, away from the street (there are many). Otherwise, the reception people were very helpful and my internet-addicted boyfriend loved that there was free internet in the lobby. The room was very clean, nice bathroom, very modern accomodations.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

Fine Location, Good Service Fine hotel in a downtown location. A mentioned by other reviewers, the rooms are on the small side but entirely adequate. Service was friendly and welcoming. I took a room with shared bathroom and toilet facilities and it was obvious that the house staff were checking and cleaning both the toilets and bathroom regularly. Reccomended.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October, our second stay there, and it was lovely. If possible, ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias. We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain, the cathedrals and the hillsides around town. The restaurant, Mark's, is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island. The hotel is a little worn in places and the breakfast was not much to be desired, but otherwise a great place to stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay, excellent choice, everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great, rooms little small but never in em only to sleep. Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive, find the cava bar by the port side street, cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down. In general spent a fortune its not cheap barcelona but you have to spend when there cause theres loads to do see ya next year  Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed. We knew what to expect in Venice and were happy to be near the train, the vaporetto, piazza di Roma and away from San Marco. The room was nice though not large, the bed and pillows very good and the bathroom excellent. The breakfast was varied and tasty. The decor is understated and the staff was absolutely first class and without attitude.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Loved the Belvedere!! I stayed at the Belvedere for 6 fabulous nights. The room that I stayed in was on the sixth floor and the service that we received was wonderful!

Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you're driving a car. The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address; according to the GPS in our rented car, the address did not even exist. It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport (if one doesn't take a shuttle), and consequently we almost missed our plane. We arrived late to check-in at the hotel (just before midnight), yet our room STILL was not ready for us. We certainly do not recommend this hotel.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

BEST OF THE BEST BY FAR Being a frequent traveller for both business and pleasure, I have to say that Hotel De L'Europe has been one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed at. The location is excellent, the service is friendly and impecable and the rooms are spotless. It is both an architectural and historical monument and for all of us who are smokers it is still offering not only smoking rooms but also a wonderful smoking lounge with a beautiful view. Both restaurants in the hotel are considered to be of the best in Amsterdam and finally special thanks to the Concierge for all their helpful information.

Great Hotel This is a great hotel, on arrival we were upgraded without asking to a delux room with great views of a wonderful city. The service here is second to none, the welcome drinks were indeed very welcome, although mini bar is very expensive.

Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big, new hotel. When you step in to the lobby of the hotel, it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s. Although, the modern amenities in the room and the lobby make the hotel really comfortable. Stay at the Maxwell if you want the small, boutique feel in a hotel.####[['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive']]
great location, great price for NYC This hotel was 1 block from restaurant row  2 blocks from the theater district plus it averaged $159 per night. A continental breakfast was also included at that price. No other place I found could even come close. I thought there were a few cosmetic things (paint, for example) that could be done but overall, it was a great place to stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

Location, Location, Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters, this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms (new plasma TV's)at an incredibly good price. Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring. Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones, etc. but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay. We had three rooms for five days (in both of the hotel's two buildings) and everyone was content. Would return in a minute.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

I love this hotel This hotel is fabulous. The location is great, the staff are lovely, helpful and so keen to help and make your stay memorable. The rooms are nicely decorated and i like the quirkly design which follow through from the rooms to the lobby area. I loved the lobby, it was cosy with the fire going and felt like someone's living room rather than a hotel lobby!!The free wine for an hour every evening was nice, you got to see everyone in the hotel and have a chat if you felt like it!!There are endless great resturants in San Francisco, really spolit for choice, especially if you like seafood!!Great hotel, great location, fabulous stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Uber-fantastic-hotel Great weekend getaway to the Commonwealth. Fantastic bed, linens, pillows -- could have slept until check out.

Nice hotel with a European feel Ace was a very nice clean place and the staff was absolutley fabulous. The location was great and so was the continental breakfast.

Its an excellent base for sightseeing in London, with The Tower of London only 5 minutes walk away and the Tower Hill tube station on the circle line closer still.

Nice, Basic Hotel with Great Location This is a basic little place, nothing too flashy. We splurged a little on a superior double room, and had a good-sized room with a balcony overlooking the plaza in front. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room itself was clean and perfectly fine. And, the location is pretty hard to beat - just a block from the Plaza Mayor, close to the bars and restaurants, not far from a Metro stop. I would definitely stay there again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Start Spreading the Muse... We stayed at the Muse a few weeks ago (Feb 08). It was a fantastic experience. The staff was great, the room was spacious (by NY standards) and the bed was very, very comfortable.

Yawn, it's another Hilton It's a Hilton. If you've stayed in one before, you know what you're going to get. Soul-less luxury, well-trained but passionless staff, a feeling of anonymity. If you're paying for yourself (as opposed to business expenses), it's probably not worth the money. Only point where the Hilton Barcelona is above average is the decor, which looks modern and a little more characterful than the average 1970's brown and bronze, chandeliers and marble that most Hiltons seem to display.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral']]
Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge -but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Heed noise warnings! I want to echo earlier reviews: Da House centrally located, inexpensive, and beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. It is, however, LOUD.

Wouldn't recommend it. This Hotel looks great online. Although the price is right, it doesn't make up for the cleanliness.

Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used (think they may have gone out of business now as can't find them any more) to the Hotel Piet Hein. When we arrived thought nice hotel, only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel's annex which was a few doors down the same street. Absolute nightmare of a room, up three flights of very steep stairs, room very dirty, ripped curtains, mould in bathroom, stained carpets, etc. Didn't get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in. In short, not somewhere I would reccomend. That said, things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago, but beware when booking, make sure its the main hotel which is really nice.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
at the monge again Exactly half a year after our first stay in the Hotel Monge we stayed here again for 4 nights. After reading some of the very negative reviews here I was slightly worried if hte positive impression we had had mabye changed. But no; we enjoyed the time there as much as before. The room was extremely clean, enough space for 3 people, the location just always again is simply perfect for buying food, going for walks (Jardin de plantes!) or simply wathcing people. So I still highly recommend this Hotel for people who don麓t want to spend too much money but want to have a nice, clean and friendly stay in a lovely area of Paris!####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Supportive Familiy-like Staff My friends and I were some of the many evacuees who waited until the last minute to get out of town before hurricane Katrina. During such a scarey time, the hotel staff became like family in that they did EVERYTHING in their power to make our stay there as comfortable as possible....not easy with the limited resources that were available after the storm hit. Our safety was their highest priority, however they did their best to keep everyone as comfortable as possible during those very unforgetable days. I do plan to stay at the Hotel Le Cirque again...if only just to thank the staff for being there for us.####[['service general', 'positive']]
Great Deal Had a nice stay here. Staff was cordial. Modern decor in the East Tower was fine. Could see that mildew beginning to build up on the bath tiles will contribute to poor maintenance. Would like to recommend Cibo restuarant on 2nd and 41st for a quiet dinner; prix fixed-3 courses seasonal menu, many choices for $30.

Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights' stay at the NY Palace, I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC. My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality, the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick Cathedral on top of those, the use of the lounge was a great boon for us, supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant, friendly and civilized surroundings, the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not-so-friendly city as New York. Also, unlike what was written in a previous preview, we were there with our five yrs old child (having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level) and he was always made to feel at home (I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there). I will definitely return to the Palace.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

The service was attentive, the rooms and grounds breathtaking. What an amazing view of the ocean to wake up to every morning! Lastly, booking at the Regency Club level meant a room in the top 6 floors with ocean view as well as buffet breakfast every morning AND cocktails and happy hour snacks (like chicken wings, kalua pork, shrimp) every night!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English. I asked for an ice machine and was almost sent down the street to a gas station because they thought I was asking for an automatic teller machine. The Cuban music at the restaurant next door started at 10 PM or so and didn't quit until after midnight. Not good if you want to catch an early flight. On the good side they did allow us to check in early and the room was clean.####[['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

The Essence Music Fiasco This establishment played the staring role in the worst trip ever! It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough, but no, they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites. Lastly, in an attempt to kill the termites maybe, the hotel has electrical problems that caused a fire, landing their guests in a 鈥渟helter-like鈥?domain, that was surprisingly better compared to the Chateau Dupre.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]

Great stopover We stopped over in Singapore on our way to Bali and decieded to stay at the Fullerton for our second time in 2 years. What we love about the hotel is the it is such are great contrast to what ever else is going on around it in such an elegant way. Everything from the bathroom amenities to the service is fantastic and we both defintaly love this hotel and cannot recommend it enough.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter, picking the location for it's convenience for the airport for a flight the next day. Rooms are small and functional, bathroom 'unit' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed. Bedding was a little strange, with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers. Staff were efficient, breakfast in the morning was good and transfer to airport was on time (despite being chargeable which is not what was advertised). It's a decent enough place, even if you still get some noise from aircraft due it's proximity to the runway.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
A Short Stay in Paris! We just returned from a quite short 4 day trip to Paris  stayed at this hotel which we have stayed at before - we loved the room w the location of the hotel is great as well however what made us most happy was the management and desk service - they were very attentive  helpful even checking on our last day that we were up  about after our wake-up call so as we would not miss our early flight - this is a very nice place to stay in such a wonderful city - gerard NY####[['location general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Heavenly stay My stay at the Westin Park Central truly was Heavenly. I can't remember a better nights sleep away from home. The room was clean, service was okay, but I can't get over how comfortable the bed was! And you must have a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice in the morning. If you are looking for a good nights sleep and to wake refreshed, this is your stop.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

The beds are hard!! If you don't like hard beds then this is not the place for you. The bed was like sleeping on a slab of concrete, which I suppose is OK if you like your mattress firm.

harming, typical Puerto Rican inn Clean, comfortable rooms in a charming typical European or Central American Inn.

A great place for the money.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Simply Fine, Incredible Value Almost everything was just right. Small hotel, front desk and bell staff unobtrusive and HELPFUL, elevators work well, bed very comfortable room clean and well supplied with basics like 4 glasses changed daily, microwave oven and small 'fridge handy, and supremely knowledgable concierge. Overall, incredible value for NYC.Location - theater district and restaurant row - not bad, although going south on 8th is very down-scale (but feels safe--lots of police blending in everywhere--never got an aggressive vibe from police or civilians). . Firestation around the corner never bothered us with noise, even though room faced the street (on 15th floor may have helped--that height certainly helped make the room bright and airy feeling.)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
Decent and great location We used this hotel for a trip to the Nutcracker. I thought it smelled like old chinese food but the the pool, breakfast, and service was really good.

Pure Quality, if you don't mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week. Had a great room overlooking the church (17th floor). I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal, service was good and the bar area was impressive. This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside, but you do pay for it - (my room rate was of around $600 a night).Overall very happy with the hotel, though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $27.####[['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'negative']]
Yikes! My family and I stayed here, and I really disliked the hotel. First thing, the room was really small and squeezy. The breakfast shouldn't even be called breakfast, the food looks gross!!

I'm gonna make sure my parents don't make us stay there again...####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Beautiful Hotel with first-class ammenities and service! We were thrilled with the staff and room at St. James. Close to the best food in New Orleans, and a few blocks away from the French Quarter, we couldn't have been more happy with our long weekend.

Brought home bedbugs Beautiful setting, but vast hotel and a little impersonal. Okay beach on a separate island that you have to take a boat to (free, every half hour). The rooms are a little worn.

And that's not a joke.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]

Convenient, Staff Superb The staff at this hotel are great and go above and beyond the call of duty. I had a terrible case of strepped throat and without delay upon check in and without asking, hot tea, lemon, and biscuits were delivered to my room to help my voice.

Nice the Paris hotel in Florence is much more than a nice and particular hotel!We booked the Paris Hotel in Florence through our Travel Agency which suggested it as a very nice and particular hotel: the Paris hotel is much more than a nice and particular hotel!Breakfast room is unique with its frescoes of the XVI century as the atmosphere in every part of the hotel. What a pleasure to sit and relax in this room having your breakfast with such a large choice of products among which ones also some Tuscany specialties... Our room had a very high ceiling with nice decorations, the ancient furniture was very elegant, bathroom was comfortable enough and very clean. Moreover this hotel is placed in a very good location: from there you can reach easily everything in a few minutes on foot.

Great Hotel Great location I booked this hotel as a result of reading the reviews. The positive reviews are all correct. This is a new hotel in a great location for a short break visit to Barcelona. 50m from the Cathedral, 200m from Las Ramblas, and 400m from Plaza Cataluyna which is the central arrival point of trains and buses from the airport. The staff are friendly, rooms and general areas clean, and the beds large and comfortable. We did not eat there as too many local cafes, reataurants and bars to experience outside, Small pool on roof terrace, a welcome respite to all the sightseeing.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Lovely hotel The rooms were beautiful and clean. Each room had a balcony and due to the low rise buildings and the landscaping, the hotel had homely and relaxing atmosphere that makes one feel like one is staying in a garden villa.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic For our first trip to Venice, and a special anniversary and birthday holiday, I cannot imagine any place could have been better. The staff was incredible, booking perfect reservations for dinners and helping us with transportation.

Three cheers for the Ramada I have travelled to Amsterdam many times but this is the best value for money hotel in it's class bar none. My room was imaculate with a comfy bed and was well designed with a cool bathroom and deep bath. The location cannot really be improved upon as it is a mere 5 min. walk to central station and even backs onto a little known red light area for some late night action. The only downsides are the lack of air-con and a fridge, but hey you do get a fan and a fridge is not essential really. All for about 拢40 per night, I have paid considerably more for a lot less, get it booked.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]

Perfect July 10-16, 2008. A steal for Venezia; includes gondola traffic (Oye!!!), singers and musicians (on the boats) - just open your window. Top service; used the kitchen to save a small fortune on breakfast and supper, thus we could splurge on lunch. (Two people, three courses and a mezzo of vino is often well over 100 euros!) Learn to shop and stock the little fridge. Absolutely would stay here again.####[['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great hotel A great hotel in a fantastic location right next to Checkpoint Charlie. I received a free room upgrade to a maisonette on the 5th floor with a balcony overlooking the street - very nice!Excellent, varied breakfast, extremely pleasant staff and good overall level of service.

Safer than expected Having read some reviews of this hotel we, as pensioners, were rather apprehensive about tales of dodgy characters and threatening transients in the vicinity of the hotel. However we have just returned from 6 days at the Della Natione and at no time did we feel unsafe or threatened, we also found the Duomo to be a 7 minute walk away not 15 and we are in our 60's. The hotel was comfortable, we had a quiet room which was cleaned regularly together with the bathroom and although the breakfast was continental it was more than adequate with supplies of foods being constantly replenished. The staff were friendly and helpful and pre-booked tickets for us when required.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Good choice We stayed in this hotel when we travelled to Frankfurt to watch the World Cup. The hotel is in a good, central location. It is close to the main shopping district and about 10-15 minutes walk away from the main square and the main restaurants area. There are plenty of nice little restaurants right next to the hotel though. This is very much a business hotel with a clean, sophisticated reception area, very professional staff and good sized modern rooms and bathrooms. We booked well in advance on the hotel's website and were able to get the room for a very cheap rate - especially considering this is a four star hotel and the City was hosting the World Cup!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

Great hotel, but noisy and location a bit off Great hotel, cool rooms and great service. Staff was relaxed and very nice to deal with. Ask for a corner room as they are slightly larger.

Great Start to the Honeymoon My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel for 3 nights in August as the 'activity' part of our honeymoon, we booked it soley as a result of its (previous) number 1 position on Trip Advisor. The hotel is super, rooms were great, staff were friendly but the location was just fantastic as we managed to walk most places (Times Square, Macy's, Rockerfeller, Empire State) and it was easy to get the Metro from Times Square for other attractions (Staten Island, Brooklyn Bridge). We ate breakfast every morning at the Red Flame Diner just down the road which was fab. The Hotel provided us with a free bottle of sparkling wine on arrival when we mentioned it was our honeymoon which was a nice touch, the staff really were wonderful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Disappointing We stayed at the Millennium Hotel our last night in Boston. The location is great, but the hotel was a disappointment. Our non-smoking floor smelled of cigar smoke, the room was small and dingy with stains on the carpet, the bed and pillows were uncomfortable and the hotel certainly needs some remodeling. I would have expected this from an older hotel outside the city, but not for the high price we paid.

>Watch out for the Extras I stayed at the Four Season Mexico City on a Wednesday in late Febuary. Overall the service was excellent and the lobby and courtyard areas are attractive. My room had two huge flat screen TVs and a view of Reforma but beyond that the furniture was nothing special for a hotel of this caliber. Also, while I expect to pay more for room service, internet access, and hotel cars in a more expense hotel like the Four Seasons, the prices seemed a bit excessive: $50 for a room service dinner of one beer, one bowl of soup, and a sandwich and $25 for wireless internet access.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Hated the Water Club While size(small) and location (directly at beach near old San Juan) suited us well, the overall experience was terrible. While many very cool design features were distinctive the negatives far outweighed these, i.e. very small room, very loud street noises and blaring music from rooftop bar until wee hours of a.m., beat up old furniture and inferior sushi and tiny pool and pretentious eating area at pool that requires you buy a bottle of liquor in order to use large sofa like banquette seating. In all fairness, beds did provide lovely ocean view and staff were sincere and very helpful. Not enough reason to ever go back.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
There are Better Options than this tired, outdated hotel I give it two circles instead of 1, only because of its location next to the Hynes convention center and Prudential Center. We paid $250 per night (convention rate) for a cramped room with low ceilings, outdated furnishings, and paint peeling from the ceiling. The hotel is not friendly to families with young children, and charges extra for items included in lower priced chains, e.g. extra fee to use the fitness center and pool, along with internet. If you want a nice room in the Back Bay, try the Lenox.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]

Loved the hotel, staff and location The airport bus (1 stop from the airport) dropped us close to the hotel (400m) from Placa d Espanya, situated on a very quiet back street but close to two metro stations (the best way to get around).Upon arrival we had to get the paperwork out to check that there had not been a mistake on the price as it far exceeded our expectations. We used a three day metro ticket to travel around, it was so easy, and the hotel gave us advice and a map. We were very close to the Magic Fountains, the tourist bus stops and Crue Coberta shopping street. The only negative was the lack of places to eat and drink but we did find an Asian restaurant with no English spoken and had a great buffet meal, better that we had in the port at a fraction of the price as it was where the locals ate, 50m from the hotel. The room was great with a large bed, a decent bathroom and a cheap mini-bar.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]

Good choice for business or pleasure The hotel Jazz is my hotel of choice whenever I am in Barcelona on business or pleasure. It is extremely convenient for the metro (10 meters) and an easy walk to Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya etc but far enough out to be reasonably quiet. Not quite sure why it is only a 3* as I have stayed in worse 4 star hotels.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
great location Just come back from a weekend away in Amsterdam staying a the hotel Des Arts. The hotel is a clean but basic hotel, no tea / coffee facilities or hairdryers in the room, the rooms were of a decent size however our room was on the top floor accessed by a very steep spiral staircase, not good after a few drinks ! There are no lifts. Its location however was brilliant , right in the centre of the city just a 20 minute walk from the central station ( or 5 minute tram ride which stops right outside the hotel ) with all attractions easily within walking distance. The staff were also extremely helpful.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
smelly rooms, no hot choc but cool view! good value but a bit crap if you consider the smelly smokey rooms and the suspicious showers. The view from the room window is lovely though, over the Amstel, very romantic sunsets and sunrise... for breakfast, there's either coffee or tea only, personnally i need some creamy hot chocolate to start the day but there were none available, only as an extra, so i had to pay 5 euros extra on the 7euros all-inclusive buffet breakfast!!!Watch out for the boozy brittish slags around the bar/lounge, they can be messy with their beer..!####[['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
Do Not Stay Here!!!!! We rented 2 rooms through Orbitz at $231 and $271 per night, and it was absolutely the worst value for the money I have ever experienced. The rooms were the smallest I have ever seen with sealed windows, loud air conditioning, amenities (loosely used) from the 1950s and room keys that did not work. We fortunately stayed only 1 night and moved to a much nicer location for the rest or our week. I would not advise my worst enemy to stay here.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
Good hotel - good location Stayed at Principal 5 days in november - in a big room in the not renewed section. Second floor with a nice balcony to the street. We think this hotel gives value for money - and is above average in its class. It has a friendly, professional staff in every function important to guests: reception, breakfast and cleaning. We appreciated very much living close to the Gothic Quarter - and Rambla. Hotel Principal will be our choice next time we visit Barcelona.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Wonderful Hotel, wonderful country, wonderful people Excellent hotel! Very nice beach and lovely rooms, pools and hotel grounds.....stayed Nov 18-25 2004 and had a great time..... this is a true 5 star hotel..... Punta Cana is a very nice place to visit.... I was in Puerto Plata as well and on both trips to the Dominican Republic I was totally impressed by how friendly the people are.....recommend the Dominican Republic to everyone you know, it is MUCH better then Jamaica and even better then Mexico.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
Wonderful Stay Was here for one night before flying out from a long, cold, wet trip. Comfortable, clean rooms. a decent location and was close to the airport. Would definately stay again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Good value, great location Stayed at the Monticello over Memorial Day weekend 2004. Was genuinely surprised and pleased that the room we reserved turned out to be a suite. I wasn't expecting that. Staff was very friendly and helpful, from replacing our mini-bar when the key broke off in it (!), to addressing a plumbing issue with a tempermental toliet, to securing our bags after checking out while we toured the city on our last day in town, to arranging for our shuttle ride to the airport. Also very convienent to the cable car terminus and other public transportation. All-in-all, a good experience.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Very good and convenient The hotel is situated in a quiet area and extremely modern - had a twin bed although for a single person so the room was generous. Had internet facility. The hotel was nicely situated from the main avenida - 3-5 minutes walk away. Value for money.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Wonderful We went to Florence for a short break. The hotel was really really really nice. Very clean and the staff were all very attentive and extremely polite. The breakfasts were delicious, and the happy hour/s of complimentary wine, juice and snacks were brilliant. A superbyly ran hotel with a lovely personal touch, we will definately be visting again very soon.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Beautiful, relaxing, great service. Loved the hotel...flew into Barcelona with my 5 year old daughter and stayed here our first 3 nights. After renting a car and heading out on a road trip of northern spain decided to book our last night here as well. My daughter was thrilled to be able to use the pool at the neighboring hotel - that she could see from our window. That hotel was much busier and we were thankful that although our hotel was geared more towards business folks that we felt very comfortable. Internet service is available on the bottom floor.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
lean and incredible staff! During my last trip to Florence, I wanted to stay in the heart of the city. Hotel Globus, close to the train station is perfect. The effort the staff makes to please their customers is very noticeable. The hotel is clean and comfortable. I definitely reccomend this hotel.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Nice hotel, good location, good faclities A great hotel in lovely grounds. The rooms are as you would expect and some have good views of Tokyo. The shops are the usual designer stuff but it does have a post office, bakery, news agency, drugstore, and a travel agency in the hotel. A good location in Tokyo, the Metro is really close (use the covered underground walkway most of the way that means you don't have to cross any roads to get there) and provides good access to both East and West of the city and Akasaka has a good mix of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. I would stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Great price for a downtown two star motel Quite possibly the cheapest price for a motel room in a major city in the downtown area. Clean room with quite new bathroom fixtures. Average friendly staff. And yes, it's on busy Market street which means a bit of traffic at night. Have stayed here before and would consider it again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Excellent friendly staff We stayed for four nights at the Castle Inn and enjoyed every minute of it. The room was spacious and clean and the oversized bathroom was a bonus. The staff at reception were always helpful and cheery and nothing was too much trouble. Even giving us super directions to start our road trip. The breakfast was more substantial than we thought it would be so again a good bonus. We would definately recommend this hotel.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Matchless in Midtown This hotel is so well located, within walking distance of Grand Central Terminal, and ideal for theatergoers. It is a fairly new tall and narrow building squeezed between two larger ones so there's little natural light, but the rooms are what you'd typically expect from a Marriott Courtyard, and surprisingly roomy for Manhattan...clean with comfortable bedding and plush towels, free internet, good in-room coffee (avoid the lobby machine stuff), flat screen TV, and most of all, a very professional and helpful staff. (We did not choose to use their breakfast option). And the price...$299 for a king-size... is matchless for a nice place in midtown. We will definitely return.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Fantastic This resort was fabulous. It had everything you could possible want. The staff was great, polite, and willing to go the extra mile. The activities were a blast. Francisco on the activities team had great enthusiasm which made his activities a great experience.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great Choice Stayed here over the weekend of 12-10-05. Awesome hotel with a great location - but out of the rush. The rooms were so quiet with a flat screen TV. They were also clean and a great size for a NYC hotel. I have stayed at the W Times Sq and the Grand Hyatt - this was much better! Would stay again!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Mind your property The hotel is pretty basic and there are better areas to stay in berlin. Do not leave any personal belongings in the room. I had my mobile phone stolen from my room during my stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Good hotel in great location The location of this hotel is excellent - within walking distance of the Ramblas and many restaurants and bars. The hotel is comfortable, and posesses great character. Our room at the back overlooking the terrace was quite small, but functional, and although you could hear noise from other rooms, there was no outside noise at all. Reasonably priced, and very comfortable, our only complaint was one rude staff member who was there when we checked in (all other staff were friendly and helpful). Would definitely recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
Wouldn't atay anywhere else in Manahattan Over the past ten years, we have stayed at Hotel Beacon four times and - having stayed at some other hotels - we would never stay anywhere else in NYC,The rooms are huge and very comfortable with a small but well-equipped kitchenette. It's a great location, stunning views to Central Park or the Hudson from the upper floors - don't forget to ask when booking because they do try to give you what you request; buses and subway within moments of the door - or just walk to Columbus, Amsterdam, Central Park, even Mid -Town. One particularly brilliant aspect of Hotel Beacon: Fairways foodstore directly across Broadway from the Beacon. a jaw-dropping selection of stuff to eat, including a hot food counter which makes eating in any restaurant a bit of a waste of time: grab a bottle of wine at the Beacon Liquor store, Korean chicken or something at Fairways then dine at your Hotel Beacon room window overlooking a million Manhattan lights. Unforgetable. Frankly at these prices there is no point in staying anywhere else, particularly if you fancy experiencing the rather attractive life of an Upper Westside New Yorker!####[['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great Location/Beautiful Resort Amongst the hustle and bustle of the busy streets of Waikiki Beach, this resort offered a nice, peaceful sanctuary. The room was very nice, great room service, excellent check-in (they check you in directly in your room). The ocean views are very beautiful. If staying in Oahu, we would definitely recommend this hotel, as you get a great beach location with a serene resort that has excellent dining, yet you are in walking distance to shopping and restaurants.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Best location We stayed at the Westin over night - and booked it on Priceline for $180. The location is the best if you want to go to the theatre. The staff was helpful and friendly - and the hotel is a really cool place to stay. The room we had was average in size - queen size bed - great bathroom and shower - great view of the city. I would definitely stay here again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
great value for money, good area Me and 4 friends stayed in this motel for a few nights in October and were very pleased with the value for money. The motel is indeed on Lombard Street, which is in fact a section of the 101, but as we had rooms away from the street we didn't have any trouble with the noise. The rooms themselves were pretty much the same as any motel room we saw during our round trip, nothing exceptional but very adequate. The biggest plus is the area, it's in a nice little neighbourhood with shops and some excellent dining right around the corner! We particularly enjoyed 'Barneys' with its 'gourmet burgers'. It's not downtown, but a short busride has you in the heart of Chinatown in no time.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
