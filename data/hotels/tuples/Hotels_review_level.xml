		<text>Sweeping city views This is a great new hotel in San Francisco close to the Convention Centre and the main shopping area. I had the luxury of staying in one of the well appointed junior suites. These are located on the corners of the building so the room has huge floor to ceiling windows on two sides (also extending into the bathroom).The room was huge, complete with iPod docking station, huge flat screen TV and a massive bathroom with a walk-in double shower at one end. All the staff were courteous, especially the cheerful spa staff and my three night stay was very pleasant.</text>

		<text>Location and Service Impeccable I stayed here for a convention that was held a few blocks away and was blown away at how incredibly perfect everything was. The price was super reasonable. The service was perfect. The accommodations and amenities left nothing more to be desired (except maybe an indoor pool but not a big deal in my opinion). Not to mention the location was in the dead heart of everything and walking distance to the convention center. I will stay nowhere else when staying downtown SF than the Palomar.</text>

		<text>good choice Stayed here for one night while visiting family. The room was small but clean and comfortable with a good range of toiletries etc. Prior to our stay we had made some requests and the hotel had fulfilled these and we found the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was also excellent, with plenty of choice and fresh foods used. I would certainly stay here again when next in London.</text>

		<text>Marriotts have never disappointed me! I just got back, had great Marriott service as I always do and would stay at this one again in a heartbeat. Great fitness center, free internet at the business center, friendly, friendly, helpful staff, very clean room, 5 star service in a 3-4 star hotel. Its also a stone's throw from the Wharf and not noisy. Price was good considering the location (I paid about $200 a night). The staff was always, always, ready to help me out.</text>

		<text>Fabulous We stayed at the fantastic Raddisson SAS Berlin over the New Year 04/05 and it's simply one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!!! As soon as you walk in, the aquarium just stuns you with its beauty and size! The staff are attentative and polite and the rooms are superb! The LCD tv's really make a difference and the room design and the 'wet room' style bathrooms are great. The spa is also one of the best! All in all, I have no hesitation in reccomending this wonderful hotel.</text>

		<text>harming, romantic, quaint No complaints. Very, very pleasant accomodating staff. Room was lovely and quite large with a king bed and ultra comfortable mattress. Neither my husband or I felt unsafe in the area even after dark, but I can see if you're somewhat skittish you might be nervous since it isn't a high traffic area like it is right on Union Square. Great shower and vanity and loved the complimentary sodas in the fridge everyday. Will stay there again on our next visit.....</text>

		<text>Stunning hotel and staff! Hotel is uber cool and beautifully decorated in a contemporary style.5 minutes walk from Sol square and tube and also the centre point of Spain!Bar is lovely for a drink and the restaurant looked equally nice but we did not eat there so cant comment on food. Rooms are a bit on the small side though!Staff are VERY attractive and also really nice and helpful. Would definately stay there again but am in no hurry to go back to Madrid.</text>

		<text>clean and New Hotel This is a very new hotel, it is a non-smoking hotel, which was pleasant. The location is very close to the center, tram way is outside the hotel about 1 mins walk, and there is a bike hire place on the basement of the hotel which was very convenient as cycling is one of the easiest way to get around Amsterdam in the day or at night. The room is very big and the toilet is state of the art. Only complain is the free wifi is on the slow side of things. The buffet was really good, and the dinner at the restaurant is nice with very nice view of the river and the other side.</text>

		<text>Frequent return business traveller Having to work away from home in the city is far from ideal and there are few quality hotels within the price range and vicinity of the Apex. The hotel is stylish and well appointed rooms with spacious beds, bathrooms, wide-screen TVs and DVD players make for a comfortable stay. The hotel has a good gym by comparison to other hotels in the area (i.e. More than the usual 3-4 machines).Room service is prompt and food standard is good. The staff are very attentive and professional. To be recommended for the business traveller or tourist.</text>

		<text>Great Room and nice place to say We only got to stay one night here -- we were on a two week trip out West -- wished we could have stayed longer. The room was WONDERFUL. The hotel was clean, staff was helpful, it was in a great location, just beautiful. We walked to the Diamondbacks game. Great place to stay, would definitely recommend it.

		<text>Great Resort Despite the coldest weekend in 16 years, we had a FABULOUS time at the JW Desert Ridge and barely realized that it was raining and even SNOWING in AZ! The JW did a wonderful job with service and addressing every need we had, and we were impressed from the valet attendant to the bellman to the room service! The grounds were beautiful and well maintained, and there were significant challenges given the temperature changes there. Truly a wonderful experience and would recommend this resort to anyone...that I like!</text>

		<text>&gt;Sent us to other hotel although room was paid already I reserved one room for my last night (21.01) in 10 days trip around Florida and for my surprise the staff told me they did not have rooms free although I had already reserved and paid the room through expedia 2 weeks before. The excuse was that some guests had spoiled some rooms, but I think they had overbooking and sent us to the Villa Capri (5 star officially, but really 3 star quality) that is just in front of Riu, but not right on the beach. They offered us free breakfast for 3 people next day and the right to use their pool, but I do not think they are serious people as they MUST respect paid reservations. On the other side the hotel seems nice and is well located close to the beach and Lincoln Rd.</text>

		<text>Great hotel, great location and good value We spent a lovely weekend at the hotel set in this quiet oasis in the middle of Madrid. Good value, nicely finished rooms and good quality public areas. Not only were the breakfasts good with lots of choice to suit all tastes, but we also would recommend that you do not miss the the afternoon tea in the bar - something we did not expect in down-town Madrid. All of the staff that we met were friendly and could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable.</text>

		<text>Worthy of the Praise All we can do is echo the praise that other reviewers have bestowed upon this wonderful oasis. What an endearing spot! We felt welcome from the moment we arrived via the tiny elevator until the time of our all too soon departure. The other reviews accurately describe the warm and friendly atmosphere of this gem. We would stay at the Colomba again in a heartbeat and strongly encourage all to do the same.</text>

		<text>&gt;Never again! Two nights - never again! No aircondition, sloppy service, unsafe neigborhood, extrem noisy hallways (doors automatically slam shut), I could go on and on and on. Do NOT believe the flood of positive comments posted here (funny most of them showed up in the first week of August and are from CA, it seems to me the hotel employees had some spare time to post . .).There are dozens of better choices in SFO.</text>

		<text>Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed here at the end of September and the beginning of October for 9 nights. This hotel is good value for money, we booked a partial sea view room which was clean and tidy. The location of the hotel is great just across the road from the beach with plenty of reastaurants and shops nearby. The only real downside to this hotel is that the swimming pool is small and does'nt see much of the sun.</text>

		<text>great location, design hotel A lovely modern hotel in a great location, on a wide, very smart shopping boulevard in the centre. Also about 30 seconds from the (underground) train station to the airport (25 mins).Apart from the usual complaints about working the lights/blinds, and flooding the bathroom with the shower, we really enjoyed the room and our stay. Booked through the hotel website which gave us a free breakfast. We were at the back, and didn't hear any noise apart from a little from the corridor.</text>

		<text>Brilliant hotel I spent two nights at Calzaiuoli at the end of last month and can't fault it. It's location is superb and although I was worried it would be noisy because it's so central, we weren't disturbed all night. The breakfast is exactly what you expect and perfectly good with lots of hot, strong coffee. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Florence and this one is definitely up there with my favourite, the Antica Torre, but this one is definitely more affordable. The perfect base from which to explore Florence.</text>

Decent sized room for NYC, very quiet, great bed, helpful staff, excellent bars and restaurants, and the most efficient elevator system I have ever seen in a high rise hotel.

		<text>a walk to everything I read the reviews on this hotel after i had booked!!!! Then i started to worry about where l was staying, but it was all good,the rooms are tired and bathrooms need renovating but you are hardly ever in your room we had a partial ocean view on the 11th floor it was very relaxing good buffet breakfast included and so close to everything. I would deffinately stay there again, from what l hear most of the hotels need a good overhaul in Hawaii, dont worry about staying there you will have a great time.</text>

My wife was on crutches ( sprained knee just hrs before the flight) and even though we were there only for one night before our cruise and were given a room more accommodating for no extra charge! Very clean suite and would not hesitate to book for an extended stay as the location was close to everything! Two thumbs up for affordable accommodations. R. Chamberli</text>

		<text>New York's finest hotel This is the best hotel in New York - over the years i have stayed in many for business and pleasure, but if you are spending your own money and want value and a lovely place to stay, this is the place. We had a park view room and waking up was a pleasure. indeed the curtains were never shut. What sets this hotel apart is the location and the extra amenities - the bar is one of the best in NY and the concierge can't help enough and it's all done unintrusively.</text>

		<text>'Fantastic Hotel' Just returned fro a 3 night stay at the H10 Montcada hotel Barcelona with 7 Friends. Fantastic hotel, staff very helpfull and polite rooms spotless and central location superb, within walking distance of all attractions just a short walk down to the marina, the tour bus stops just up the street (鈧?20 / person all day unlimited travel). Travelled from the airport on the service bus ~ 鈧? per couple returned by Taxi ~ 鈧?25-30. Glass of carva on arrival and the breakfast was very good (if a little expensive). The bars and restaraunts around La Ramblas can be a little expensive but the is plenty of choice just off the main streets. Would certainly stay in this hotel again.</text>

		<text>Great Location, Great Staff, Rooms a little Small (but hey, it's Paris) The location was great (facing the Pantheon, close to the Metro) and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We'll stay again nexy time we're in Paris. The only minor negative is that the rooms are awfully small (huge beds make it even worse). You can pay more and get larger rooms so that may be a good option. All in all we had a great stay and recommend this hotel to anyone.</text>

		<text>Great stay and very convienent We got this hotel at a last minute bargain, and I am glad we did. The room, although small (but not smaller than normal European hotel rooms), was very comfortable. The king-size bed was fantastic and I always enjoy a place that gives you a robe with the towels. Very convienent, right next to Dam Square and walkable from the Train Station. I would definitely stay here again.</text>

		<text>Excellent value I stayed in the hotel from 23-24 December. An excellent stay, nice spa, good food, very friendly staff and quite affordable. Check all the websites for offers, the prices I found varied 40 EUR per night. The hotel is in a quiet zone in the centre of Berlin, 15 min. walk to Potsdammer Platz with e.g. the Neue Nationalgalerie and a 15 min. walk to the Ged盲chtniskirche.</text>

This remains the best Singapore city hotel in my view, since it has the most attentive staff and best quality food around. Another strong recommendation!</text>

		<text>Hotel Allessandra was great We just returned from a 10 day stay in Italy with 3 wonderful evenings spend at the Hotel Alessandra. I highly recomend this quaint, perfectly located hotel. just 2 blocks from the Uffizzi and one block north of the Arno, the location is perfecto. More importanly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The service stands out as some of the best I have experience-the staff was very outgoing and knowledgeable with recommendations for meals. Be sure to chat with the delightful and engaging Monti-his Joie de vivre is infectious and he is loads of fun.</text>

		<text>Enjoyed the Orchard Experience Booked this Hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The Hotel is small but very reasonably priced for the area. The rooms are very comfortable and we had great nights sleep, didn't eat in hotel as was abit pricey for our liking, they did recommend very good eating places nearby that suited our requirements perfectly. Overall we were very pleased with this accommodation, and would choose to stay here again. The Cable Car is very handy but quite expensive to travel on single trips, so get a long term or multi trip ticket from the start.</text>

		<text>xcellent resort March 27, 2005We returned from Punta Cana yesterday and still are amazed at how wonderful the resort was. Especially the calm...quiet breeze, waves crashing on the shore, wide open beach, lots of empty lounge chairs waiting for us, and no vendors. The food was amazing, especially the breakfast buffet. There was so much choice and everything was beautifully prepared. The wine we were served is good quality. Champagne was available at all times!We would return, and recommend this place to everyone.</text>

		<text>Fantastic pools, shame about teh beach replenishment Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in October 2008, and whilst the rooms were pretty bland the pools and outside areas facing the beach are lovely. 3 pools - one infinity, one with a pool bar and a spa pool. The hotel is right on the beach but the beach was being replenished during our stay so you couldn't actually use it and had to walk to the main Kuta beach (about 5 - 10 minutes). All, in all though this is a good holiday hotel and the staff were always very friendly.</text>

The food in the italian restaurant was very good as we went with the nightly special. The food at the revolving restaurant was excellent as was the service,although it was a little on the expensive side. The views are spectacular. The only thing that the hotel could improve on was seating in the main lobby--there is a couple of chairs and a couch and alot of empty space.</text>

Our first bedroom was on the fourth floor at the back with a view of the inner courtyard - would have been fine if the room had not been so hot. Complained and told that this room did not have air-conditioning - moved to the room previously described with floor level windows and air-conditioning.

Hotel is classy with a beautiful lobby and front desk area. Beach area is shared with other hotels so it can crowded early. We do not recommend the dinner cruises, they are over rated and over priced, do a luai instead. Hotel is recommended and if you get room 1609 you will have a good ocean view without paying for it!</text>

The staff were friendly and welcoming right from the start, with plenty of charm and good humour (which we found unusual in Spain on the whole)! Rooms were very clean and well maintained. It's in a great location for the night-life (ramblas) and was within easy walking distance of good bars, resturants, and other attractions. I'lld recomend this mainly for younger people, singles or couples as the nightlife in the immediate area is vibrant to say the least. Overall, a great hotel with excellant service, presentation and modern amenities, would stay there again without doubt.</text>

We had read previous reviews and knew what to expect - despite the Crowne Plaza brand this is three star/travel inn standard (not the four star advertised) - so find a good deal  only pay three star prices!

		<text>Perfect Location... Fun Hotel Just returned from a two-night stay at the Triton, and I have to say my experience was in contrast to that of some of the other reviewers who felt there was a lack of restaurants in the neighborhood or that the staff wasn't helpful enough. We received excellent recommendations for dining in the neighborhood (Taylor St., Ryoko and Le Colonial) both nights of our stay from helpful concierge, Nick. Add to that a perfect location -- practically in Chinatown, right next to Union Square, and convenient to the waterfront--and a fun decor. It's true that some facilities could use better upkeep (e.g., plumbing), but for the price, I would go back to Triton again in a heartbeat.</text>

When arriving at SFO airport, I called the shuttle line and was told that it would take about 10-12 minutes. I have seen all other hotel shuttles twice, before the Sheraton one arrived. The staff is friendly enough. I had diner there too, which was quite good, but the temperature in the restaurant was rediculously hot.</text>

		<text>Benchmark in Hospitality My fiancee and I flew down to SF from Canada and were extremely impressed with the decorum and class of this hotel. From the elevator completely covered in pages from old books, the complimentary Aveda shampoo (my fiancee was particularly fond of this), timely valet service, and exemplary service, staying at Hotel Rex made our stay in SF a flawless experience. Based on price, hospitality, and location, I would highly recommend this hotel my closest friends and not hesitate to stay there again. Jim GintherSaskatoon, SK, Canada</text>

		<text>Superb! My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights (and mornings and afternoons) at Matteo's beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal. His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated, and treat each other, like old friends. The wonderful terrace, for breakfast and evening spritzers and whatever else you'd like, provides the remarkable setting. Although near the Rialto bridge, serenity reigns. Al Ponte Antico is a magical place and we will return again and again.</text>

The staff knows us and we always get excellent service and treatment. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the restaurant is fantastic. It may not be a luxury property, but with the money we save we can eat at the most expensive restaurants around and thoroughly enjoy ourselves. I do not think I would stay anywhere else.</text>

		<text>I liked the Mosser The Mosser is a very clean, comfortable, friendly, attractive hotel that's in a great location in San Francisco. It's also inexpensive. The only drawbacks - which are no secret - are that the rooms are small (although very well arranged) and the bathrooms are shared (or at least mine was). If you're OK with that, definitely stay at the Mosser.</text>

		<text>Wonderful hotel This is a wonderful hotel, probably the best we've ever stayed in, lovely spacious room and bathroom, and the friendliest and most helpful staff, with no exceptions. Its location is excellent too. Well worth paying extra for access to the executive lounge. Even the heavy rain couldn't dampen our enjoyment as the hotel provided huge umbrellas free of charge for the duration of our stay. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definitely stay there again!</text>

		<text>Tradeoffs This location has huge tradeoffs. The good news is that this is a convenient tourist area with amusing sights such as street performers. The bad news is that the area also attracts activity such as pickpockets and other mischief. Factor that risk into your decision whether to stay near Las Ramblas.</text>

		<text>Nice We stayed here for 3 nights over new year's and couldn't really fault it. The concept, the design and the comfort levels are all worthy of praise, as are the staff, one of whom on seeing us getting out of a taxi in a downpour, met us at the door with a couple of towels. Nice touch. Thanks Sonja.</text>

		<text>Lovely My friends and I stayed here for four nights over the St Patricks day period. Our rooms were on the 36th floor, really nice rooms, very clean and modern, maid service every day. The only thing I would fault would be, some of the reception staff are quite rude, and keep an eye on your bill with the bar staff, if they are serving at your table, keep tabs of what you had as they do seem to try to add drinks on that you haven't had, or imply you haven't paid! This also happened to another couple who were staying there the same time as us!Apart from that, good location and a lovely hotel, would stay here again.</text>

		<text>mfortable, Clean,  Stayed at the Ohana West from 1/22-1/29/05, was pleasantly surprised after reading many mixed reviews. We had a city/mountain view, king room, on the 16th floor with a nice size lanai, the room was a little small, but clean and comfortable. The daily housekeeping service was very prompt and did a very good job, and all the staff at the hotel demonstrated excellent customer service. The location of this hotel is perfect, it is centrally located to all the great things to do in Oahu. If your looking for a 5 star hotel this is not the place, but if your looking for a nice place with reasonable rates and great service, then this is the place to stay.</text>

		<text>Excellent hospitality Our large group discovered the Europa via Trip Advisor, and all the previous positive reviews are spot on. The Europa doesn't seem to appear in any guidebooks, and the entrance lobby downstairs is unpromising, but once you arrive in the hotel, Gassim and his daughter Miriam are wonderfully discreetly attentive hosts. The rooms at the back are quiet and elegantly furnished, and the hotel is perfectly placed - a couple of minutes' walk from the Duomo. Our group of 13 stayed for a week, and felt we really had found a home from home.</text>

If you're travelling by train, this is definitely the hotel for you. There are also international calling booths across the road at the train station and a post office to send souveniers to your family and friends, just across the road. Breakfast was great and there is free internet.</text>

		<text>Beautiful Hotel in the Middle of Tokyo After staying in the Akasaka Excel Hotel, we moved to the Prince because it was cheaper and are we glad we did! The Prince is a beautiful hotel with big, modern rooms (some with a panaoramic view of Tokyo). The service was also excellent and the price was excellent. We never ate there as there are many local dining options just down the street. Highly recommended.</text>

I really appreciated that there was hotel staff located on ground and then again in the hotel lobby checking to be sure that only registered guests were entering the hotel. The front desk staff, housekeepers, concierge, security, and porters were all very nice to the kids. The price of the hotel is on the moderate to high side but the location (1/2 block to the Times Square subway station), experience, and high quality made it worth it.</text>

		<text>Brilliant location Simple, clean, efficiant hotel in an ideal location for restaurants and attractions. Metro nearby too. Stayed there with family and also for a rugby weekend. One word of warning..... don't go to Aarapana Indian Restaurant nearby. It was dreadful!</text>

		<text>Good Hotel, Good location Hotel Aalders was the best choice we could have made. Good location, nice hotel with extreme friendly staff. The staff was a big help to reserve several tours for us as explaining where to go in Amsterdam without feeling a tourist!!!!Our room was clean and comfortable with television, telephone and in the bathroom bath, toilet, sink, hair and shower gel and a hairdryer!!!At the hotel bar you could use the internet service at any time. Breakfast was good with different choices and we could come in to the hotel at anytime of the day or night because of the day and night receptionists. We were very happy to stay at the Aalders Hotel and will return for sure to this hotel when we are back in Amsterdam.</text>

		<text>Great location and spacious room Can't argue with the location (short walk to Universal Studios, short drive to Hollywood and downtown), or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom. Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day (you will need time to explore LA). Only downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access. Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances. Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced (extra to cost of room) Overall, pretty good, just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls.</text>

		<text>blissful retreat It was a while ago, but we adored Uma Sapna. Having our own pool was fabulous. On the downside it IS quite a long walk from the beach/restaurants etc, especially in the dusty heat. Fabulous restaurants in the vicinity. Great value for money (which is slightly unusual in Bali).</text>

		<text>Totally ok I spent there 3 nights in the begining of May, nice hotel, just few block uphill to famous Lombard street, the same walking distance to Fisherman Wharf rooms were cleaned, front staff very polite and helpful. Free access to computer in a lobby. Breakfast maybe not interesting (just donats and crossaints), but wake up coffee is there, and free covered parking can allowed to forget about breakfast. I'd come back again, good spot.</text>

		<text>Great small hotel in the old town There can't be many hotels on earth owned by such a fascinating man as this one. The rooms are all equipped not only with everything you need for a very comfortable (and affordable) stay, but also with copies of the owner's writings - thoughts, reflections and words of wisdom, a kind of cross between Khalil Gibran and Marcus Aurelius. He himself is an inspired and inspiring presence, and a stay in his wonderful, charmed hotel is capable of changing the course of a person's life. There are testimonies on the internet to this effect. It seems he will drop everything for a deep conversation with a guest. The hotel also has a wonderful rooftop bar and restaurant, which is great place to catch the evening light and eat excellent local gourmet food.</text>

		<text>Great hotel, great service I was impressed by all aspects of the Affinia 50. Sophistication without the attitude, which is so hard to find. When I was concerned about how to find a particular restaurant by cab, the person at the front desk found the restaurant in the NYC Zagat guide and made a copy of the listing for me. The service from the bell staff was equally terrific. I can't wait to return!</text>

		<text>New Cliff Vilas best in Bali We spent seven nights there over Easter and stayed in the new Cliff Vilas. For under $US600 a night incl breakfast, it was extraordinary value for money. The vilas are the size of a house, with a large and magnificent private pool, cabana, grounds, living room and bathroom that is equal in size to half the vila. You see the ocean from every room, the butler was great and whilst the staff were not the most efficent in the world, their efforts and kindness make up for it. 10 out of 10.</text>

		<text>Great hotel, excellent location We (a group of 10) stayed at the H10 Marina in June 2008 on a hen weekend, and I would highly reccomend this hotel. It is clean, well kept with minimalist modern decor and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The location is also great, about 10 minutes walk from the bars at Port Olympic. The pool area is quite small, so if that is a priority for you it may not be ideal, but as we didn't have time for sunbathing that was no issue.</text>

		<text>OK Location but noisy rooms Hotel Balmes looks very plush from outside and in the reception area, however we were in room 13 and it was very dark and also very noisy, didn't get too much sleep during our stay. Our room was spacious though and had a seating area as well as sleeping area and nice bathroom. The walk to Placa Catalunya was about 20 minutes I would say, which was further than I had originally thought, but it was easy to find our way around. Didn't have breakfasts at the hotel. Used the garden area, but not the pool although it did look very tempting, but the weather wasn't really warm enough.</text>

The hotel is extremely well situated; the owners/staff could not have been nicer or more patient and accommodating; the rooms were immaculate, and ours was of quite decent size. We didn't take the breakfast, but heard from our friends that it was lovely. We would absolutely recommend Hotel Casci to all of our family and friends traveling to Florence, and we hope to come back soon ourselves.</text>

Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away</text>

		<text>New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.</text>

HOWEVER, the front desk screwed up a simple Kinkos delivery for me, and my traveling companion's reservation- then tried assigning blame on him despite his ability to produce confirmation numbers and dates. All ended well, but customer service was AMAZINGLY bad. Probably fine for tourist travel, but be warned that for business travel this is the worst Starwood property we've ever stayed in.</text>

They were very helpful in directing us around the city to restaurants. It was a no-frills boutique hotel that felt like home, and that was the best part.</text>

		<text>Look no further for your Sydney stay If you're looking for a comfortable, central hotel then look no further. Our room was well proportioned and clean, staff went out of their way to help us and our three year old daughter. Slap bang in the middle of everything tourist wise, it's about a ten minute stroll from Circular Quay and five minutes from Darling Harbour. Can't recommend this enough!!</text>

		<text>Excellent Hotel My wife and I just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Regina in Barcelona. This hotel is highly recommended. It is very convenient to the main shopping street; the room that we had (#403) was situated at the front of the hotel - it was very comfortable and quiet; the staff is friendly and very accommodating - making dinner reservations, reconfirming air reservations, etc. I would definetely stay at this hotel should we make a return visit to Barcelona.</text>

		<text>The quiet jewel in the quarter Was apprehensive about staying in the French Quarter with the sounds of a party echoing from Bourbon Street. But found this small hotel, only 1/2 block off of Bourbon, to be a quiet jewel. With a good hotels amenities and a friendly and helpful staff, I found myself able to complete my buisness and enjoy some of the nightlife made famous by Bourbon Street. I highly recommend the Hotel Saint Marie for buisness or pleasure.</text>

		<text>Obsessed with this hotel! We got a great deal on Orbitz for this amazing hotel. The location is outstanding, smack between the Duomo and Piazza Signoria. We had a room facing the back, from which we could open our windows to overlook the picturesque Florentine rooftops and an overwhelming view of the Duomo itself! Our room was huge; comfortable and modern furniture, a very clean and beautiful bathroom (maybe a tad on the small side) but a separate sitting room with a sofa/twin bed and separate TV with its own amazing view. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!</text>

		<text>Friendly, helpful staff The best part of Casci is the staff. They were very helpful with recommendations- directions, restaurants, etc. This was our second hotel in Florence, and compared to the first, Casci had a little more of a hostel kind of feel- signs in the bathroom asking you not to clean your laundry in the sink, for example. This was the quietest of all hotels we stayed at, which was nice. The location was great- down the street from the Duomo, street markets, and within walking distance of the train station.</text>

Very good breakfast and the one evening meal we had there was first class too. All in all a perfect hotel from which to see Beijing from and the best hotel we've ever stayed in.p.s. when walking around Beijing take toilet paper with you as the public loos don't provide it!!</text>

Staff were very helpful, location amazing and metro so close - although Notre Dame and Latin Quarter was only 15 minutes walk. Mouffetard was a lovely district up very closeby, with great bars and restaurants - we loved 1001 Nights Morrocan bar with hooker pipes and Avocado milk shakes! The market at Mouffetard on Sunday was gorgeous - cheese meat fish coffee veg chocs baked goods....... etcetcetcAny way this was by far the best value stay in Paris, and saw some gorgeus quieter quarters as well as the main sights.</text>

The staff were fantastic always on hand to offer friendly advice from where to go on day trips to which Restaurant to eat in. We stayed in room 501 which had a fantastic view and a good size balcony. I am planning to go back to Florence in September and would definately stay in the same hotel and with a bit of luck the same room.</text>

		<text>Not too bad Having stayed here a number of times in the past the hotel is beginning to show wear a bit. Staff were pleasant and helpful throughout which is always as I have found it. The room facilities are as you would expect and the rooms are quite spacious (from a European point of view).I like this hotel because of it's proximity to the Central Rail Station where I can get into and out of the Airport quickly without relying on a taxi (or other transport).Food is of a reasonably good standard for breakfast. The Restaurant is highly regarded for it's Dutch food. The hotel is close to the nightlife centres without being on top of them - Dam Sq being about 5-10 mins walk.</text>

From the Wharf area you can catch a trolley car or sightseeing bus to other parts of the City. Overall the hotel is great for the value. The lobby is large with a warm atmosphere and helpful concierge desk.

It is easy walking distance to the centre of Florence or there is a great inexpensive bus service. As there is no restarant and bar if you are hoping to meet other guests this hotel is not for you, but with a hotplate and fridge cleverly hidden in the room it is great if you want to do your own thing.

The hotel is very conveniently located to the airport and downtown and is just a short cab ride to all the action in South Beach. The hotel was recently rennovated -- and my room was nicely furnished. The lobby was nice and the service I experienced at this hotel was excellent.

The room itself was spacious and well designed with plasma TV, DVD player etc. The buffet breakfast was exceptional - probably the best in any hotel I've had around the world - and well worth getting included in your rate if possible. The hotel location is good with some sights, shopping centres and a metro station nearby.</text>

		<text>Great hotel I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great. Room was very small but was perfect for us, it had all we needed including a minibar and a very nice bathroom. We stayed for three nights in total, it may be a bit small for people on a longer stay (1 week).As mentioned in other reviews, it have a more of a BB feel than a hotel feel so if you are looking for somewhere more like a hotel then I would look elsewhere. Would definetely recommend Residence Foch, the area was perfect, literally max ten mins walk from the Arc de Troimph, lovely safe area.</text>

		<text>Happy -- Again Having booked a standard room for our second long weekend at Ku鈥檇amm 101, we were positively surprised to be given a comfort room for the same price. The young staff was very friendly and helpful, again. When the going gets tough in the breakfast room though, the service isn鈥檛 always up to speed. Important for those who like to sleep late : breakfast till 13.00 on Sunday is a nice touch. We鈥檒l be back.</text>

		<text>Lovely Having stayed in the Sofitel in New York and thoroughly enjoying it - I decided to give the London one a try - and I wasn't disappointed. Very simply it was lovely!Concierge - helpful and friendlyFront desk - friendly and efficientRoom - absolutely lovely - particularly the shower! and spotlessly clean. Also really quiet due to very good double glazing - so between the quietness and the comfortable bed I had a fantastic night's sleep. Bar area - friendly. I was slightly worried that they might have been a bit pompous - but not at all!I would be delighted to have an opportunity to stay here again.</text>

		<text>&gt;Does the job ! A perfect place to crash whilst in transit through Frankfurt . This Hotel is clean, cheap, ideally situated next to the Central train station and staffed by friendly and professional people who do their jobs very well. It isn't exactly a Hilton / Sheraton but in so many ways is so much better ! A honest budget Hotel that will almost certainly exceed your expectations.</text>

		<text>Location is just one feature here We had four great days here recently - location is fantastic given that there is so much within walking distance (including stadia and railway station), and if it rains (which is does here) transit is free in a large zone of downtown. Front desk staff could not have been more helpful and have a sense of humour, the concierge knew the answers to the questions we had, and the room was quiet and clean and comfortable. We will return....</text>

		<text>Met or exceeded ALL expectations! We are a family of four (two adults and two daughters, ages 18  20). We stayed in one of the apartments for five nights and in two of the hotel rooms for one night. Only one negative to report--the new paint fumes in the hotel rooms on our last night. Other than that, I STRONGLY recommend this property. Very clean, very quiet, excellent location--two METRO stops close by, safe and secure, comfortable beds, friendly  helpful staff, walking distance to excellent retaurants, reasonably priced.</text>

		<text>Did not love the Chealsea Lodge First of all, I rely on Trip Advisor for my traveling. The room that I stayed in was horribly small. The TV didn't get great reception, the shower kept going from scalding to freezing, and there was a huge pipe in the room that kept whistling like a tea kettle. The cleaning staff was very friendly. However, when we explained to the problem with our room (whistling pipe), they were not willing to accommodate us at all.</text>

		<text>A Beautiful Place in a Very Good Location Stayed here for three nights in June 2008, 2 adults and 2 teenagers in the annex rooms, second (third) floor. An absolutely beautiful place, clean and new with real Venetian decor (go to the Ca'Rezzonico museum and see the same style furniture you have in your room!). Breakfast was very good featuring home made apple croissants. I am a super light sleeper and on the first night heard noises from the private residence above our room - Walter and Sandro at the front desk contacted owner of the building the next day and immediately resolved the issue, they were super nice and helpful. Not hard to walk to this hotel from the train station - save some money on the overpriced vaporetto tickets and head there on foot.</text>

		<text>Good for a Stop over We had a somewhat small room in the 鈥渢ower鈥?section of the hotel, which I think is mainly used by stopover passengers en route to Australia. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was very clean and welcoming. Wardrobe space was somewhat limited after luggage storage and the small sit in bath required careful negotiation in order to stand in a flat area for a shower. The room although small was pleasant enough but the lighting was very poor and I found it very difficult to read standard size font (such as 11 of 12 point) after it had got dark.</text>

		<text>Good hotel, good location Stayed here for a few on nights on way to Sydney in November 04. Like a lot of other reviewers, i thought the room was small but in a place like Hong Kong you shouldn't be spending too much time there. Staff were friendly and helpful and some good info from the tourist desk. About 10 minutes walk from the busy streets of Causeway Bay, but 30 seconds from the MTR station and trams which are cheap and reliable (buy an Octupus card at the airport!).Tremendous, mainly unrestricted views over Hong Kong, harbour and Kowloon from the rooftop pool. Restaraunt a bit pricey, but reasonable value European/Asian buffet breakfast. No problems at night with karoke - although Bridge Over Troubled Water in Cantonese is interesting.</text>

		<text>Truly amazing Returned on 12th June - it was fabulous. Even better than the photos!In addition to all the things other people say in their reviews aboutthe pool, drinks, food, luxury room etc, I especially liked the beautiful design of the resort and lovely touches like the wonderful selection of colourful plants and flowers, parrots, flamingos, fish etc. We also enjoyed the poolside activities eg Spanish lessons, Aqua Aerobics - thanks to the activity team who did a great job. My only complaint would be the Thomas Cook rep who was hopeless and the MyTravel flights to/from London Gatwick which were the most uncomfortable flights I've ever had the misfortune to take.</text>

		<text>ice city shame about the hotel we stayed for 1 week in August 4-11th,2008, found hotel to be showing its age ,Doormen and staff very polite and courteous. But as a show Hotel for Boston ,I think it could do with some updating. As some people have said it is surrounded by some good buildings ,such as Trinity church and the Library,but is overshadowed by the monster skyscraper of the Hancock tower. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends or family as I believe more modern hotels exist in the city. What I can say is we experienced some history that the hotel showed in its makeup.</text>

		<text>very good value We visited Berlin in June 2004 and found the hotel very clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were larger than expected and great value for money. The hotel was within walking distance of Alexanderplatz where there is a very efficient metro system serving most areas of Berlin. In the evenings we visited some bars within walking distance of the hotel but admittedly hard to find which were open very late. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.</text>

		<text>Great location, friendly family-run hotel Nice family-run hotel in a great location - just a couple blocks from the Duomo, Galleria dell'Accedemia, and close to many other sites (although I do recommend taking a taxi from the train station if you have luggage - cost is only about 8 Euro from the train station to the hotel). The owners and staff are extremely accomodating, offering good advice to restaurants (their recommendation of Za Za's Tratorria was so good we went back our last night), tours and anything else you need to know. They made reservations for us for dinner and a tour and we were happy with each. They take pride in making sure everyone enjoys their stay.</text>

The staff is rather unpleasant, decoration is inexistant, rooms are tiny and beds are too soft, no air conditioning in the rooms which are just under the rooftop, and to finish breakfast is mediocre (no croissants or pancakes only bread, no choice in fruit juices etc...). The only good point is its location right on the Dam place.</text>

We traveled with our teenage daughter who enjoyed being close to the hip boutiques such as HM, Urban Ourfitter and Forever 21. The room had hard wood floors and was clean and cosy. The lounge on the second floor was really convenient and had washers and dryers which was super. We will stay here again!</text>

		<text>Great Place to Stay We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton 3 nights from July 1st. That was the second time we've stayed at the Sheraton and like the first time, we enjoyed our stay very much. The only thing was that it is under renovation so it was a little inconvenient but it was still a great stay. The rooms were very nice and the staff were very nice and helpful. If we went back to Seattle, we would definitely stay at the Sheraton.</text>

		<text>A Doggie Hotel, Not for People The smell and stains in hallways and in rooms tells everything..... this hotel caters to people with dogs. We checked into our room and the stench of dog with potent cleaning solution smell practically knocked us over. The staff was friendly and tried to accommodate, but they said there weren't any rooms that were designated for just people. So if you don't mind paying to stay in a room where dogs have obviously been, then Summerfield may be just the place for you.</text>

		<text>Kid Friendly in SF We stayed at the Argonaut last weekend for my cousin's wedding and were very impressed. The service was outstanding - both toward us and our 2 year old. We had a king sized room, which was fairly small, but well arranged, so we didn't feel cramped. The staff was very friendly and even brought our son a gold fish to take care of during his stay.</text>

		<text>problems in paradise I was travelling on a family gathering in Miami, and my family booked at this hotel previously. I arrived at 2230 on a Thursday and Friday morning enjoyed the breakfast they offered, subsequently we left the hotel around 1430 on Friday and returned at 1600, on return luggage from our room had been stolen. My major concern was the way in which the hotel handled this, the first question they asked was should we call the police? I also noted that on return at least 3 room doors were opened by housekeeping and the rooms unprotected by employees, thus violating their own policy - to get into this hotel you have to go through a gate into a secured compound. My warning is this: the hotel accomodations are nice and pleasant, be very careful about your possessions and use the safe!</text>

		<text>Great hotel, shame about the price increase! We enjoyed a fantastic Mother-Daughter trip to Paris in August and were very impressed by the quality/cost ratio of Regent's Garden Hotel. We got a really nice, recently refurbished twin room for only 99 Euro (booked direct on the hotels website).However, rather large negative: A few weeks later, having been so impressed by the hotel that I was planning a second trip back there to stay with my husband, I was told by the hotel that it had just been upgraded from a 3* to a 4* hotel and that subsequently the price has increased from 99 Euros for a Classic room to 169 Euros! A huge increase which dramatically changes the 'value for money' aspect of the hotel. While I would agree that an increase was warranted based on the refurbishment, it does not warrant a 70 Euro increase and it's a real shame as it puts a nice little hotel in the unaffordable category for a lot of people who would previously have stayed here (a comment I made to the hotel).</text>

		<text>Good location, comfy beds Rooms were great although the bedroom area was a little on the small side, the bathrooms and comfortable beds really made up for this. All sights within easy walking distance - 5 mins walk to the flower market and 15-20 mins to Museumplein. Near to metro, trams and canalbus stops. Just round the corner from the hotel is Utrechtsestraat which contains some of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. During our stay there was a lot of unexpected construction work (both to us and the hotel) which the hotel kindly compensated us for. Would definitely stay here again.</text>

		<text>Great base for seeing LA We were very pleased with our stay at the Holiday Inn Universal Studios (formerly known as the Beverly Garland). Although it is a bit noisy due to proximity to Highway 101, it didn't stop us from sleeping and the proximity to 101 meant driving around was easy. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the pool area was great and the food in the restaurant was excellent. Altogether great value for money.</text>

		<text>Elegant Hotel, excellent position, but some minor flaws We stayed here in late September 2003, and would recommend it for position, and its effortless elegance and style. A five minute walk from the Duomo and various excellent side-street restaurants make it a very strong choice. That said, those minor flaws: as in other hotels, rooms vary in quality from tired and jaded to newly refurbished with Tuscan pain effects - so negotiate for the better ones. Breakfast was mediocre with catering being run by an outside conmtractor! Be prepared to part with $25 a day for parking as well. But overall the setting- especially the roof-top bar terrace - gave this a very strong rating.</text>

The Perak is not like the big chain hotels but is a great value for the money in Singapore. For around $70USD per night you get a clean (albiet small) room, with basic but nice appointments(Cable TV, A/C, DVD, free wireless internet, etc), a good location in vibrant Little India, and basic but tasty buffet breakfast. I had no complaints other than a bit of street noise late at night when a neaby bar was closing up.

		<text>Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Vibe Hotel and I thought, for price and location, you can't beat it. They had just recently undergone a massive renovation and the rooms were modern and comfortable and included any amenity we could have asked for -- minus complimentary towels at the rooftop pool which was slightly annoying since we called down to housekeeping 3 times and were clearly ignored. So basically, aside from lack of towels at the pool, out stay was comfortable and hassle free and exactly what we were looking for.</text>

Concierge and all the staff very helpful, however I did find the cost of drinks a little on the steep side, as was breakfast. Pool a little disappointing, more of a large plunge pool.</text>

		<text>Decent with good quality/price ratio, but noisy The hotel is in a good location, the rooms, at least the low priced one i got, are really small although you can survive for a week if you just sleep in there. The window in my room was loose and the first two nights it was not properly warm. I tried to put the room temperature regulation on, but the fan was really noisy, so i opted for an extra blanket. My room was facing the rear street and it was rather noisy early in the mornings. On the average, i would suggest this place, at least for the cheap rooms, to the budget conscious traveler.</text>

		<text>Discreet Charms Of The Neri On Tripadvisor comments I booked this hotel for a short 4 day break - we weren't disappointed. It is the perfect small hotel with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Having travelled extensively, far too many hotels rely upon offering a plethora of services that guests will never use. The Neri, in common with good hotels, simply concentrates on providing excellent accomodation where a good nights sleep is guaranteed, excellent assistance from the helpful staff, and a wonderful location for sightseeing. The hotel deserves to succeed.</text>

Desk service is condescending, except for the sheets rooms are really not well-maintained, carpet is badly stained, and everything is worn-out. Good but noisy location with thin walls. Downstairs breakfast restaurant looks mediocre and expensive, though the night club looks intrguing. Would stay again only if stuck. Tip: Unless the season is very busy, you can probably get very deep discount coupons at Visitor Center, so don't reserve ahead.</text>

		<text>a warm and intimate hotel in a big city We recently spent a long weekend at The Benjamin. I have to agree with all the previous positive posts. The location is good, the room was great, the bed comfortable, the staff friendly without exception. The only problem was that our refrigerator did not work properly and they were not able to fix it during our stay. We plan to stay at The Benjamin again soon.</text>

		<text>Reviews are right on for this one We stayed at the Cancellor Hotel in July during part of our honeymoon. The reviews on this website are right on spot regarding the hotel. The hotel is older and the rooms are smaller but very clean and the staff is very helpful. They made our honeymoon special with champagne and a gift in our room at check in. On a side note, we loved the restaurant next door for breakfast called Sears.</text>

		<text>very good experience at this hotel Stayed for 2 nights while touring through Texas. Located to the north of the city but convenient for attractions (if you have a car). we did the JFK museum in downtown Dallas before heading over to Fort Worth Stockyards and then to Southfork Ranch so you can do these attractions in a day from this base. Nice restaurants and other facilities. Excellent well appointed room at very competitive rate. Overall a very good experience and would recommend this hotel.</text>

		<text>Good Hotel Booked a package through Eurostar, a nice modern hotel near the peripeherique, 5 mins walk to the metro and then 15 mins into the centre of Paris. In the centre of conference / tradeshow town so could be busy. A good room, clean and tidy and attentive staff. A check in problem was expertly and politely solved. bar expensive and you are better off taking breakfast in a local bar than the hotel (15 euro buffet anyone?). Recommended for a long weekend, we'll stay there again.</text>

		<text>Great Little Boutique Hotel! The Hotel Londra is a beautiful little hotel with great accommodations, excellent service by the hotel staff, and the best dinner that we had in Italy was at the restaurant in this Hotel. Breakfast is served each morning, with a generous choice of bakery, meat, egg, fruit, and drink choices. While the location is a bit of a walk from the center of town, we enjoyed walking and seeing the community every bit as much as we enjoyed all of the historic sites. Our room was clean, spacious, and we enjoyed a magnificent view which was perfect at sunset. We will definitely stay at the Hotel Londra the next time we are in Florence.</text>

		<text>Fantastic location We stayed here for one night on the 3rd leg of our Honeymoon and it was fantastic, we had a suite with a little kitchen and a lounge and a large bedroom. We were travelling with our 7 year old little girl. The location was great as it was only a 10 - 15 min walk to the CN Tower which was great. In the morning we received a complementary breakfast which was great and it set us up for the day. Would definatly stay here if we returned to Toronto.</text>

		<text>Lovely hosts, but catered towards Americans The hotel is quaint with a lovely terrace and nice hosts, but seemed as if this place was more geared towards americans, with some surprise at guests that are not americans (i.e. us). This is probably due to the american wife of the owner couple. Unfortunately this made the hotel seem less diverse, whereas Florence is very diverse!!The rooms are large, but some features such as bathrooms do need updating. Breakfast is not included, which is a shame as many hotels in Italy offer it.</text>

		<text>Loved It After reading the reviews on this site, I was terrified of my choice, but had already paid in full through Expedia. The hotel turned out better than I expected and I completely relaxed. Room was charming, although it was the absolute smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in, and the bathroom was really itty bitty!Didn't have much contact with the staff, but what contact I did have was pleaseant. I arrived at the hotel at 11 a.m. was allowed to check in, which helped me enjoy a full day in San Francisco without worrying about check in times, etc. I took Bart from the airport and highly recommend it over taking a $40 or more taxi ride.</text>

		<text>lub is great! We stayed here for 3 nights in club and although the rooms are on the small side and showers lack any real power it was Jean and Joyce,the concierge, that made our stay here more than comfortable. They arranged everything from reservations in the best restaurant in the South West (Binkley's) to a hot air balloon ride over the desert, they just could not do enough! The Club lounge is exactly as a lounge should be, full of great food and masses of free drinks all through the day and more information about the area than you can shake a library at. Would highly reccommend, but only in club.</text>

The hotel is quite basic,with a bar fridge and kettle,very clean and well located in Wanchai,with shops (two good bakeries nearby) and Times Square an easy walk, transport is very close. The concierge, the doorman and the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive. The twin bed room was more spacious than the double room, the beds are easy enough to push together.

		<text>Superb breakfast view Ok, I'm a little biased because Berlin in the snow in mid-February is inspiring, but this was a superbly located hotel, with great facilities and very helpful staff (whose English is far better than mein Deutsche). My girlfriend pointed out that were it slightly further up the Ku'damm, by only about 75 metres, it would be more expensive to reflect the slight-change in area, so it really is a bargain. I've never been in a hotel where for such little outlay you have a MASSIVE bath in a marble bathroom, set in a large, well laid-out clean and comfortable room. My top tips would be to have the (very ample buffet) breakfast there, whilst enjoying the view from the 6th floor -fruhstuck even runs until 10, so you can still have a bit of a lie-in; and to get a City/ Welcome card, as the hotel is very close to stations for all the forms of transport (except trams, being located in the West), thereby utilising its much raved about location. We would eagerly use it again.</text>

		<text>Multiple Great Stays For the 3rd time in recent months stayed at the Sheraton Metro Center, off Dunlap Ave and the Black Canyon Freeway (I-17 N). Received upgraded status on 2nd and 3rd stays in addition to the normal Gold Member service that have come to expect from Sheraton Hotels. Great service, very friendly staff and they serve an excellant complementary full American style breakfast. Easy access to the Metro Center Mall as well as easy via I-17 to Phoenix Sly Harbor Airport. Will definitely stay again when in Phoenix area.</text>

		<text>Fine but pricey stayed here for a long weekend - nice hotel and obviously can't beat the location - we were in the castle club which is worth the extra money as had 'character breakfasts' every morning - that way you can gets lots of photos and avoid eating in the hotel for lunch and dinner - had the buffet at the Inventions restaurant one night which was awful - go up to the Disney Village if you want to eat something decent for half the price - there is a planet hollywood and a few other acceptable chains in the village - good standard of room but OD'd on the air freshner - very comfy beds - staff were fine - kids loved the weekend though which is the whole point - still considering the cost could make a better effort to feed the grown ups</text>

		<text>Better than expected Stayed here for a conference located at the hotel. Based on previous reviews I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was pleasantly suprised. The room was clean and large, nice bathroom/dressing room set up. Conference facilities and food were above average. The staff was very friendly and helpful.</text>

		<text>Silly Style Over Substance I spent two nights at the W recently and had to supress myself from laughing on several occasions. The pool has the letters WET printed on the bottom - thanks, I would never have guessed... This place has pseudo-hip styling flourishes that serve no purpose and dance music is piped into every conceivable public area ( gym, elevators,lobby,restrooms, etc.). As you approach the main entrance, large motorized drapes automatically part and reveal - a staff of slacker twentysomethings ! Overall, those over age 26 may want to look elsewhere.</text>

		<text>Superb location and wonderful room We stayed in room 609 at Swissotel from 9th to 11th August to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The location is superb right by Dam square with many great bars and restuarants only a short walk. It only took about 15 mins to walk from central station. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and our room was excellent with all amenities and a huge ensuite. Everything was extremely clean and tidy, would definately return again.</text>

		<text>Ideal hotel We really liked this hotel, we were originally booked for the Kempinsky but due to a mix up we couldn't get in, and booked this very much last minute. The hotel is a little tired however they are working on that and it will be rectified, the breakfast was wonderful with lots of choice. All in all we would definitely stay here again. If you are going to Berlin for a few days and know how to ride a pushbike we would strongly recommend the fat tire bike company, nothing too strenuous, but a great way of seeing the city.</text>

The hotel team was quick and eager to help with any projects: my wife and I felt we were a respected part of things, and Paris became accessible and comprehensible for us. We recommend the Hotel Monte Carlo.</text>

		<text>There are better choices I stayed at the Shinjuku Washington, hoping to save a bit of money on a trip to Tokyo. The hotel lobby was in a chaotic state and the staff were not particularly helpful or courteous. My room was clean, but truly tiny and in need of refurbishment. I had to pay extra to leave my luggage for a couple hours after check-out. I would prefer spending more for a nicer hotel, such as the Century Southern Tower in the same area or the Mercure Ginza.</text>

		<text>Highly recommend the Berchielli We spent 2 nights at the Berchielli last week, and the experience was completely delightful: perfect location (on the river, an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio); friendly, attentive staff; spotless, attractive rooms; and an excellent (hot) American breakfast. Other family members had spectacular river views through 2 huge windows in their rooms. My single room, which I referred to as the princess room, since you went up 2 flights of stairs to enter the sleeping/bath area after you came in the door, had no view, but was so delightfully quiet that I happily accepted the trade-off. The size of the hotel was perfect, with a boutique atmosphere. I loved Florence, and will hope to have the opportunity to return and enjoy the Berchielli again.</text>

		<text>firmed reservation, but no room available when we arrived I reserved two rooms several months in advance and confirmed them via email one week before arrival. Nonetheless, we were apologetically told by the staff that they had overbooked and had no rooms available and were transferring us to its sister hotel Colon. Unfortunately, the Colon Hotel rooms turned out to be run down, with stained upholstery, linens, and carpeting, no air conditioning, and an old, lumpy bed. We found a new hotel. I never saw the rooms at the Regencia, so I can't comment on them (the lobby was simple but clean), but the experience was disappointing and stressful as we scrambled to find an acceptable hotel.</text>

		<text>Mixed review We celebrated my husband's 60th birthday and I had booked 4 rooms. We had problems with the final billing for 3 of those bills. I received an internet rate of $64 a night, but the bill indicated $127 and we were charged for a valet service that we did not have for one room. Check your billing statement. Also, the rooms were very small and our view was the room of the building next store, but for $64 I can't complain. On the other hand, great location and the staff are very nice.</text>

		<text>Easter in San Francisco We had a very nice clean room with plenty of towels for our family of four. We did not use the restaurant, but found many places within walking distance for all meals. The wharf area has plenty of eateries and things to see. This Sheraton is not a resort - so we didn't expect to dine, swim, or exercise while visiting. This is a clean safe place to stay while visiting a major US city.</text>

Although it is not especially plush the Moore Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.</text>

Great resturant is buffalo at Houhai lake, you will have a great time in this fab city!</text>

		<text>Rude people at the QT Bartender in the hotel was a jerk and used strong language towards my wife and I. After complaining to the manager, she made us feel like it was our fault for requesting a drink around midnight. Don't call the hotel for rates, shop through Hotels or something similar for best rates. Another couple traveling with us got a cheaper rate by doing so, and the manager would not match their rate. OK location, 1/2 a block from time squ. Not sure if I would ever stay there again. There are a ton of hotels and I say, look elsewher</text>

Room had a very musty smell and was damp. Bathroom small and disappointing. In summary a hotel with beautiful exterior let down by sub-standard rooms.</text>

		<text>Diamond in the Ruff The chancelor is ideally located, seconds away from Union Square, and you can catch the trolley to take you to the trains/MUNI or just walk it, its just blocks away. The rooms are beautiful and cozy. The staff is amazingly helpful and accomadating. The weather in SF makes it unnecessary for AC, an open window was just enough for us... and we're from TX where AC is absolutely necessary!</text>

		<text>Great anniversary night! We were able to check in early (probably as it was a slow day - the Saturday of a three day weekend) and the desk clerk, when entering our Hilton rewards card number, found out it was our 32nd anniversary. She upgraded us to a fabulour corner room, facing the harbor and gave us complimentary access to the executive suite hospitality room. The staff were all very nice, from the bell man who gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do once we got there, to the desk clerk, to the health club attendant, to the shuttle bus drivers. Would stay there again in a heart beat! Was only sad it was a one night stand at the end of our vacation!</text>

		<text>I'd stay there again I spent a week at Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel in May of 2003. The service was great, the rooms were clean and decorative, I enjoyed the breakfasts set out by the pool, and the location was great. We were right across the street from Waikiki beach and within walking distance of several shops. I would definitely stay there again in the future.</text>

		<text>Great location The hotel is very central and clean. However, on checking in, they told us our room was in another building across the road, which turned out to be another hotel but owned by Hotel Victoria 4. The rooms were tiny, noisey, with no natural light and a view of the hotel room opposite. Would recommend this Hotel for its location but I would insist on a room in the main building of Hotel Victoria 4.</text>

The welcoming and efficient staff made everything go very smoothly and our room was lovely. The hotel is very handily placed for London Bridge mainline and tube and for the attractions of the southbank (Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre and Borough Market) all in easy walking distance, although it would be a good base for any visit to London. I've stayed in a number of well known central London hotels but this is the one I will return to. Very nice breakfast too!</text>

		<text>perfect for romantic getaway This is such a cool hotel, very noirish, rat pack, 50's, space-age swingin' batchelor pad kind of vibe, with funky and artsy overtones. Very romantic if you're thinking of that kind of getaway with your loved one... great views of the city. I guess it's a little off the beaten path, but if you have a car you'll be all set. Check out the Bishop Arts district which isn't too far away.</text>

		<text>Loved it! The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful property located close to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City. It's located a floor or two above a large shopping center (handy as there are banks, drugstores and quick/cheap places to eat). We stayed on the club level which meant check in was in our room (nice touch), we had a separate concierge (albeit not speaking english as well as those in the lobby) and a delicious free breakfast and afternoon drinks. We had the grand suite - a nice bedroom with separate living/work area.</text>

Although the bathroom in my room seemed a little dated compared to others in the hotel, the whole room very clean and comfortable offering excellent value for money. Location wise, the hotel has plenty of cafes and restuarants nearby as well as some excellent patisseries. It's between two metro stops and one metro stop down from the Gare de Nord, so for getting around public transport / in and out of Paris it was ideal.</text>

However everything else was great and in contrast to the evening meal, the buffet breakfast was fantastic. Room very nicely decorated, 11th floor had great panoramic view from Greenwich to Crystal Palace. The location is also good just yards from South Quay DLR station.

		<text>&gt;No Internet access in hotel rooms !! The hotel itself is of average quality but there is no Internet access of any type in hotel rooms! The staff could be somewhat more polite and helpful (at least in opinion of someone used to European standards). If you use the shower be aware that you may get burned as the valve system is obsolete and not well maintained. The hotel is located very close to the airport, but not so easy to find as there are no road signs indicating proper direction and the hotel name is not visible from main roads.</text>

		<text>Such elegance! I loved The Kimberly! It's small, as hotels go, but I never felt claustrophobic in it and especially not in my room. The parlor was comfortable, the kitchen surprisingly complete, and the bedroom was QUITE spacious with an awesome bed. The staff was delightful, especially the doorman, an older African American man, who was quick with a smile and never, ever gave me the feeling he was looking for a tip (which made me tip him more!).It's conveniently located to many midtown attractions and also the subway at 51st and Lexington. I would definitely stay here again, but word to the wise: make sure you get your car out of the garage within a 24 hour time period or they will charge you for an extra day, even if you're only a minute or two late!</text>

		<text>Jury's Boston Beautiful hotel, lovely rooms, but for 拢150.00 per night they should be! Only complaint was the food. Bar food expensive and not very good. For breakfast recommend Au Bon Pain. 2 minutes walk from the the hotel and excellent and extensive and cheap menu  Small friendly hotel The staff in this hotel were very friendly and helpful. The bedroom was big enough for the few days we were there. We had breakfast 3 mornings which was good value for money. Thought overall the hotel was excellent value for money in a good location and would return to this hotel if I visited Barcelona again.</text>

		<text>Best Location in Barceloma This is possibly the best located hotel in Barcelona - right in front of the Gothic Quarter, and only 5 minutes walk to La Ramblas (just far enough away). Also, right on the harbour front which is ideal for restaurants and shopping. Room and service were excellent and highly recommended</text>

		<text>Seriously lacking This particular Four Seasons property was absolutely forgettable. From the moment we pulled up, the service was way below expectation....sitting in the car with the luggage for several minutes (no bellhop) and having to re-circle the property to get help with the bags, to the missed wake-up call, to waiting for 45 minutes for a coctail server to approach our table in the lounge... everything seemed to be a bit off. The saving grace of this hotel (aside from the great location)would be front desk/management team. They were overall very professional and super courteous.</text>

		<text>Great location; Comfortable hotel - shame about the building We picked the Radisson by chance out of a very long list of Boston hotels. Despite being the ugliest building in Boston it is a comfortable hotel whose location is fantastic for most of the central Boston attractions. The bed and breakfast package is good value tooRooms were comfortable and well furnished and most with great views (ask for a high floor number). The foyer and pool are dingy and in need of a bit of work</text>

The rooms are quaint, and the beds are very comfortable (including egypitian cotton sheets that are very soft). They have a complimentary wine and cheese event during the late afternoon. I would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends!</text>

		<text>Prescott - A lifesaver THe Prescott came to my aid after I left another hotel around the block which could n't provide high speed access. They set me up with a wireless bridge which worked perfectly with my laptop. I had no problem with cell phone reception in my room and probaly made 50 calls at the time. THe only reason I didn't give this lovely hotel excellent is due to the limited room service. It is difficult to find a place in the neighbourhood to get a reasonably priced meal - you don't want $30.00 entrees every night.</text>

		<text>Avoid like the Plague Have traveled to Amsterdam over 10 times and never stayed in anywhere so TERRIBLE. The rooms were tiny (2 beds in 1 room and 3 in another). The bed was for someone aged 5 or under and the views of a concrete wall were awful. After checking out i was told i had to clean my own room which i did and then 1 week later was charged and extra 150 euros for what i don't know. I'm persuing legal action so avoid this place like the plague.</text>

		<text>Fantastic place for the price For the second time in the span of about four weeks I'll be visiting London on business. And for the second time I booked my hotel stay at the Parkcity. As others have mentioned, the hotel is situated at a clean and relatively quiet location in Kensington. It's within a short walking distance from Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum. The staff are friendly and a pleasure to chat. I was suitably impressed with my previous stay at the Parkcity and will be so again in early July.</text>

It's for you who are looking for cheaper great location, walking distance to the centrum and Amsterdam Centraal station. It's not to clean and rooms are small, typical down town European. I stay there because of price and location only and only when I'm alone, would not offer it for family.</text>

		<text>Good value for New York Stayed for 6 nights from the 9th January. Had to wait till 4pm for room(official check in time 3pm)The offer of a complimentary drink or pot of tea would have been nice but not offered. Room was big by NY standards and best view over NY I've had in 6 stays in the city. Very central for all attractions and the staff helpful and efficient. Very surprised nobody has mentioned the Westway diner on 9th Avenue between 41st and 42nd street as a great place for breakfast-or for that matter any meal-they're open 24/7.</text>

		<text>Functional downtown hotel Stayed for 2 nights in July 06, a functional hotel located slightly away from downtown but within 10 minutes walk of most of the sights. I'd have this down as a 3 star rather than 2.5.Received a warm welcome on arrival, and we were able to check-in despite arriving early, lots of information offered by the reception staff and secure underground parking (for $16 per day).Room was clean but not huge. The receptionist advised that the hotel was going to be refurbished later in the year, but it had cable TV, air con and everything else you need when your planning to spend most of your time exploring a fantastic city like Seattle. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on the first day but it was over-priced and the food wasn't great. On the second day we chose to go to one of the many local coffee shops, which was much better and cheaper!</text>

		<text>Great hotel Fantastic hotel as you will have seen from the other reviews. Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed and the duck by the bath. Very central for business travellers and there is an MTR station below the hotel in Pacific Place, a massive shopping centre but not cheap!The only slightly negative thing I could say about the hotel is to do with the swimming pool location. The hotel is next to the Shangri-la hotel and in the afternoon the Shangri-la blocks the sun from the pool. Other than that the place is faultless.</text>

Yes, the hotel was within walking distance of the Space Needle. However, when I requested a 2pm check-out (we did not check-in until after 7pm) as per the special services extended to Choice Privileges members, I was told the latest we could check-out was 1pm; the room was small; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed; only one elevator worked and it was slow; the complimentary in room coffee service was provide only for one person; after showering, the bathtub took forever to drain (over 8 minutes) and left behind scum; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room; the business center computer was out of order; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service.</text>

		<text>Great place to stay Stopped for three days on the way to NZ, and enjoyed immensely. Room pretty good although can get a bit noisy outside, saying that my 5 year old slept perfectly. The reason for 5 is partly for location but mainly for the excellent staff, for example we arrived and I had lost the suitcase keys. the desk guy managed to find a saw and had freed up our possesions before I returned with (superb) coffees from opposite 7-11. Nothing seems to be too much trouble. Will certainly stay again on next trip over to NZ</text>

		<text>super time, gorgeous place put simply, I loved this place. It was a nice little hideaway on a great shopping street. It was so pretty and quiet, the staff always smiling and happy to help. I must have called them for rides 10 times while I was there and it was never a problem. I also loved their pumpkin soup and lime juice. I hope to go back again, this time for my honeymoon.</text>

		<text>hristmas In New York The city is very busy during Christmas, but we had a very good time. The Mariott Marquis is the place to stay if you can afford it. You can walk to all of the popular shows and we felt safe on the streets. We were in a group of 8 and we all had a wonderful time.</text>

		<text>Superb hotel, great staff, fab location Just returned from a 3 night stay in Barcelona with my mum. Booked this hotel after reading good reviews on this website and it did not disappoint. The location is fantastic, lots of great sights within walking distance and no matter where we wanted to go, it cost us less than 5 euro's in a taxi. The staff were very friendly and took time to point us in the right direction for the sights we wanted to visit and also recommended and booked restaurants for us free of charge. Our room was very comfortable, they remembered to not give me feather pillows and the free minibar was a lovely touch. Cannot praise them enough.</text>

		<text>Great Location! For those who've never been to San Francisco, The Tuscan Inn (near Fisherman's Wharf) is the perfect first. We were near all the transportation modes (and there are plenty), shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Our room was large and comfortable, and the staff was top-notch (especially Elmer). If you have a question, they have the answer or will get it for you. We were very pleased with The Tuscan Inn.</text>

		<text>Rude and disorganized staff Arrived from a very long flight with my husband and 3 yr old toddler. The initial receptionist was very pleasant and checked us in without any problems as everything was in order with the room number already printed on the reservation slip at the front desk. After settling in and resting for about 2 hrs, we received a shock of our lives when someone tried to open the front door of our apartment but failed then we got a call from the front desk. The Manager (some guy) had the gull to ask us to move out to another room as the room is meant reserved for someone else and said the earlier staff that checked us in was new. So what if old or new staff, this is not the way to treat guests and not even an apology was given for their mistake! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!</text>

		<text>Great location, fun district and nearby a major subway/train station We usually stay at the Peninsula when in Tokyo for business, but a Japanese colleague recommened the Cerulean. The location was great, walking distance to the side-streets of Shibuya and the Shibuya train station which has connections to many of the major tourist sights. The hotel itself was adequate and clean. Service was good, but still not compable to five star hotels like the Peninsula or Four Seasons. A friend mentioned the Italian restaurant there was good, but we didn't have the chance to try it.</text>

		<text>Excellent value for money We stayed in this hotel from 29th Dec to 1st January. The hotel is small and the staff are very friendly. The room we stayed in was larger than we expected and was extremely clean and comfortable. As other people have stated, the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy walking distance to other livelier areas of the city. It is also a short walk to the nearest metro station. Considering what some of the other hotels were charging in Paris, I would consider this hotel to be excellent value for money.</text>

		<text>A great hotel! This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service, and it is within walking distance of most attractions (we timed our selves strolling to the Duomo and it took about 6 minutes). I know that many times the star ratings on travel websites do not have any basis in realiity, however, this time I completely agree with the rating on Expedia.com that it is four star hotel. The rooms were great, the breakfasts were very nice, and I loved that the shower products are from the famed nuns at the Perfumia Santa Maria Novella. We stayed in Florence for a week and had a wonderful time. If you would like to know anything else about this hotel, or places to eat in Florence, please feel free to email me at foodiedb@optonline.net.</text>

		<text>Fantastic Our company used the Michelangelo Hotel for a business meeting with 16 participants. The hotel was fantastic, from the absolutely wonderful rooms to the service, and the great European feel. The staff was helpful, friendly and the meeting staff was available non-stop. They do not have a business office per se, however, they were willing to make copies for us in their offices, and Kinko's is a couple of blocks away. Definitely a great experience.</text>

Many hotels claim to be 'historic' but really thats just a cover up for being a bit old and lacking in services, not so with the Adolphus!The Adolphus was great, room was big, and good value for money considering its location and the standard of the furnishings.

		<text>&gt;Caveat on 'Ocean View' Room We booked an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower. There was a nice view of the harbor, but the only way you could actually see the ocean from our room would be to step out onto the balcony and lean over to see a small sliver of Pacific. I complained that this did not constitute an ocean view in my mind, but the hotel staff told me that is how the room is classified, and refused to move us. Other then this disappointment, the hotel was great.</text>

		<text>Great hotel in a very convenient location I really enjoyed my stay at the Abba Sants hotel. It is very comfortable, modern hotel. It's location, a few minutes walk from the Sants train station, is very convenient for travelers who are visiting the city. The hotel staff was great about giving restaurant recommendations that locals actually go to. The only downside was that the rooms were uncomfortably warm and the only way to cool down was to open the window which unfortunately let in the noise from a very busy street.</text>

		<text>Good Value and Location Spent 3 nights ($110 per night) at the Ilima in Dec 2005. Very happy with the proximity to Waikiki Beach and the surrounding designer boutiques (Gucci, Chanel, Prada, etc.) and restaurants. This is not a 4 or 5 star establishment, but that is OK, since you are not paying prime $$$. The rooms are outdated, but clean, comfortable, and roomy. We found the staff to be friendly. If you are looking to save money and be within walking distance to all the action on Waikiki, then stay at the Ilima.</text>

		<text>Great Place to Destress..... Just returned from 3 nights at the Maya Ubud which was absolute heaven. We stayed in the superior garden villa - and the only sound to be heard was the birds and the occasional thwack of a tennis ball. The Spa is situated in a great location and the elevator ride down to reach the infinity pool and facilities is a great way to avoid the steps! We both had the 75 minute massages and it was so tranquil to only hear the sound of the river flowing below and the odd frog!The amenities around the hotel were excellent and we ate in most of the restaurants and found the service and food to be fantastic. We also did the nature walk with a guide and enjoyed going through the villages and walking through a rice paddy. All in all a great place to stay if you want to have peace and quiet but be close to main centre (5/8 minutes away)</text>

Room was good size, free washer/dryer on 8th floor, housekeeping and turndown were great. Hotel was busy, but still able to offer personal service.</text>

		<text>Best hotel in in Oahu We had a fantastic holiday in the Hawaiian Prince last month. The staff were very helpful and friendly and I would like to give a special mention to Brenda who made our stay very special for my husband 50th birthday (upgraded us to a beautiful room with a fantastic view) . Also a special mention to Linda who worked in the pool area and was always helpful and attentive. If we every come back we will definitely stay in the Hawaiian Prince hotel.</text>

		<text>Shabby is definitely the word Checked into the Sheraton and asked specifically for a room NOT overlooking the construction. Got a room overlooking just that. Ripped curtains, dirty carpet (from construction dust). This property is not run by Sheraton, just under their umbrella. For the price charged, I would NOT recommend staying there. Perhaps Sheraton should review some of the hotels they license to outside owners.</text>

		<text>Disappointing Given the reviews I read about the Oberoi and the reputation of the chain, I expected excellent and consistent service. We were surprised at the lack of consistency of the service and had a bad experience with the staff's confusion regarding whether breakfast was included in our rate. The management is clearly not doing its job in ensuring consistency and communication amongst the staff. The grounds, however, are beautiful and the location is lovely, however I think there are better value for money options in Bali.</text>

		<text>ral location with friendly atmosphere. We stayed here early October and even though we had done our homework on location, were pleasantly pleased with the hotels location. In the heart of the city, just a few steps away from Chinatown and easy access to the two cable car lines or street cars, to give you quick tranportation to the main attraction areas. Ok there is street noise but then again you are in the centre of a city and the lift can be heard but not enough to disturb you. Our room was on the ninth floor and the view from the window overlooking the roof tops was lovely, the bathroom was very modern, and it was handy to have a safe deposit box in you room at no extra charge. We found the hotel recepitionists all to be very helpful.</text>

		<text>Not what I expected unfortunately. After booking in for business travel I was given a small rooom with barely enough space to walk around the queen size bed. Not very luxurious with regular TV etc (no flat sceen), and no view from the 6th floor. I requested a better room and was given a room on the top floor right next to the elevators, which were noisy and disturbed my sleep. After requesting a room change again I was given another average room by front desk staff who seem reluctant to help. As far as deluxe hotels go this place is really quite average - I think there are many better 5* hotels out there.</text>

		<text>Great value Hard to imagine better value for the money. The room was clean, the location great, the staff courteous (although sometimes a bit flustered). If you want great value, stay here. If you want a hotel where the staff grovel at your feet and lick your boots, then stay somewhere else and pay much more. A note for critics of the staff ...a few thoughtful words in French will pay substantial dividends in terms of service.</text>

		<text>Recommended Hotel In Hong Kong Nice hotel on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong (I typically prefer Hong Kong Island side as its closer to my favorite shopping areas and cool neighborhoods like SoHo). I'm definitely a fan of the Shangri-La chain of hotels. The service is always fantastic and you get a feel for the Asian culture. The rooms are very nice, spacious, and well decorated. The lodging was very reasonable when I stayed there - around $200USD/night - more than worth it!</text>

The room was clean, a good size, and there were all amenities needed and more - including a kitchen area.

It was a good hotel but the location was a bit out of the way, it's not in the heart of the city and you either have to walk a bit or take a taxi to get anywhere. But its right on the river and restaurant is very good!</text>

		<text>Best hotel in Amsterdam This hotel is a personal favourite of mine. An Amsterdam townhouse on a quiet side canal, yet within walking distance of just about anything you want to see (and convenient for Anne Frank's house in particular). The rooms are HUGE, well appointed, with clean bathrooms, fridge, TV, buffet breakfast and friendly staff. It's the only place I would stay in Amsterdam. Try for a room on the canal side.</text>

		<text>ice hotel We had a beautiful room, very big, with a comfortable bed and a huge bathroom, But this is an old hotel, dated. I found it not very clean, the carpets were dirty and also the restaurant was like that (and food was not so good...). I didn't like all that cement, gray walls. Anyway, people working there were nice, we arrived late at night but they allowed us to have dinner even if the restaurant was already closed, and they gave us a lot of information: very nice and polite. I think it is a good hotel if you have children (the pool is very big), but it is too much expensive for the quality of the building.</text>

The rooms are fine and spotless, the breakfast is great but what really makes the hotel is their fantastic staff who are friendly and willing to give good recommedations for restarants etc. The location is also good, very central and we had 3 rooms in different parts of the hotel and none of us suffered from any of the noise referred to in earlier reviews. - despite us being 40ish year old women.</text>

Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as were the bar and restaurant staff. The two front door men were exceptional, always happy and helpful even in the dreadful weather Boston experienced during the whole 4 days. A well run hotel with pleasant helpful staff, a lot of whom have worked at the hotel for many years - always the sign of a good hotel.

		<text>Wonderful Visited for 3 days in March 2006 for our sons 21st birthday, What a great City and an even greater hotel !! We looked on Trip Advisor prior to going and the Savoy was highly recommended, we were not disappointed. Situated in the Plazza Della Republica with great views this is a beautiful hotel with great rooms great restaurants and some of the best trained staff we have ever come across, the service was second to none and the manager should be proud of him/herself. The location is great with all the attractions of Florence within easy walking distance. Our rooms were at the front directly overlooking the Plzza Della Republica, it was amazing , we could look out and listen to music playing every night, from violins, to salsa, opera and the atmosphere was electric - Cant wait to go back !!!!</text>

		<text>better for pleasure than business As lovely as other kimptons in terms of quality of finish  amenities. Very servicable fitness area, in-room desks with wired net, cute nautical touches. Right smack in the heart of the tourist waterfront. I would come back with my spouse for vacation or if you're a business person dragging family then this would be a great fit. Some of the rooms are quite spacious and would be good for families. As a straight business traveler it was a distracting location, with a low noise level that I'd roll with if I were vacationing too but was hard to not feel curmudgeonly when I had 7:30 am meetings.</text>

Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia. We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there. The beach was within easy walking distance.</text>

		<text>Above average, good value Spent 2 nights at the Eastgate Tower, in mid-town Manhattan. It is well located, close enough to Grand Central Station to catch the trains, a healthy but do-able walk to Broadway Theatres, and there's a decent bagel place (Daniel's) a couple of blocks away. The room (2 beds) was large, with a kitchenette, which is very convenient for storing and heating up food (there's an oven/range+ microwave, sink and fridge, with dishes and utensils provided). Maid service included dish-washing. TV was an older CRT model.</text>

		<text>Great small hotel Spent a week at the Hotel de londres eiffel. English speaking staff. Clean rooms but small. No restaurant but plenty others close at hand. If you are not looking for luxury and want to experience the local atmosphere I would recommend this hotel. A bonus is that it is 3 blocks from the Eiffel Tower.</text>

		<text>Efficient, patient, friendly I stayed at the Savoy for a shopping weekend in Berlin and found it a superb elegant hotel. The lobby and the restaurant simply invite to sit down and relax. The room we stayed in was huge, clean and utterly comfortable. I have to mention the staff of the front desk and in the restaurant are efficient, fast, patient and friendly. Each of our requests were taken care of immediately. Will be back soon.</text>

		<text>Just like they said... The Jazz was just as I had expected it to be. The hotel was nice to look at, there was a rumble from the underground, the rooms were clean and looked as they did in pictures, and it truly is very close to La Ramblas. All in all, for a three-star hotel it was great -- certainly great value for the money.</text>

		<text>Overall good For the price and location you can't do better. The staff is very friendly, you are 30 seconds away from the beach on foot, and 30 seconds away from buses to the airport or old San Juan. Isla Verde (where the hotel is) is a safe touristy place but, of course, old San Juan is far more picturesque -- and far more expensive... Make sure to eat at PLATOS, the hotel's restaurant: some of the best food I had in Puerto Rico and, again, very reasonably priced.</text>

		<text>Spot On Not one to write these types of reviews generally but would liketo leave a few comments on the Hotel D'Albe ( Rue De La Harpe ) as accommodation in city centres can often be hit and miss. Went with my wife and my parents for short break via Eurostar to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday and can only say experience was superb. Staff were very helpful with all travel ,restaurant and river cruise bookings - as said location ideal,premises were very clean and would definitely recommend to any friends/family in the future.</text>

The location is excellent, close to several major tourist spots and close to public transportation (5-10 mins walk to underground stations and a bus stop (24) right in front of the hotel). For anyone who does not want to spend a fortune staying in London, I strongly recommend this place.</text>

		<text>Great find in a beautiful city Stayed at this gem of a place over the christmas weekend and really enjoyed it. The location was very good, in the Southern Canal Belt which was close enough to all the major attractions without feeling too touristy, and the tram links were frequent and convenient. After reading the previous reviews was actually prepared for a small closet room but the bedroom was pleasantly spacious and definitely one of the bigger ones I've seen in Europe. The complimentary minibar was a nice finishing touch, and the Living Room reception area, with a cheery fire and free flow of drinks and snacks, was a lifesaver for those cold Amsterdam afternoons.. All in all, a great place and would not hesitate in recommending to any</text>

Lovely quiet room at the back, no view to speak of but didn't need it as the hotels central location means that more time is spent outside the room than inside!

The hotels cancellation web-page is non-responsive and my hotel-issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box. I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer's comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e-mailed his cancellation.

I stay here for business a lot and can really spread out, like having an apartment while I'm away from home. The staff isn't the best, but friendly and accomodating. If you are going to the convention center, this is one block away. If you're leisure traveling, there are other great places to stay in the same rate level with more character, but for extended trips it can't be beat for the price and comfort.</text>

Standard Hampton morning breakfast, helpful staff, but very small rooms, so if you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it might be cramped. Walking distance to most lower manhattan toruist sites, and the deli around the corner is very good. Nothing fancy, just gets the job done.</text>

		<text>a true oasis I stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and previously wrote a review based on that stay, saying i thought the value vs. price was not worth it, that it was overpriced for the caliber of hotel it was purporting to be, but I TOTALLY retract my negative comments. i just stayed there again on my last visit to London and couldn't have stayed at a finer hotel. the price is very comparable to other luxury hotels in London and what you actually get in return is tremendous, beginning from the warm welcome by the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff, to the welcome glass of champagne and array of snacks, to the invitation to join them for canap茅s and drinks in the evening and the turndown service with candles, robes and slippers laid out. it's a true oasis from the rush of central London. you won't regret it!</text>

Recent refurbish is good though ensuite is small - who cares the shower works well.

		<text>Treat in Amsterdam I stayed at the Piet Hein with my boyfriend for 2 nights in March based on the user reviews posted on Trip Advisor and wasn't disappointed. This area of Amsterdam is great as it's out of the main hustle and bustle, near the museums and close enough to be able to hop on a tram and be in the heart of the action. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful and the place was clean as were the rooms - nice white linen and a bright, clean, modern bathroom. The hotel is also located right next to Vondel Park, great for strolling around and watching the locals run, jog and walk their dogs (sometimes at the same time!).I would definately go back here when next visiting Amsterdam.</text>

		<text>Wonderful exterior but damp  The Fullerton is in a fantastic location - especially if you are doing business in Singapore. And it looks great from the outside. But the rooms can be very damp and musty - and I've stayed in this hotel on about 8 separate occasions now.... Plus worst of all is that sometimes in the middle of the night I've been woken up by extremely loud airconditioning noises. Not acceptable in a 5 star hotelIf in Singapore and looking for a decent hotel I'd recommend 4 Seasons or Raffles The Plaza as better hotels for similar or lower price.</text>

		<text>&gt;A perfect beginning A fantastic location providing excellent value for money. For 拢50 a night in central san francisco this hotel is certainly a find. The continental breakfast is a good start to the day including waffles, breakfast croisants, cereal, toast and huge muffins. The hotel is two minutes from union square and close to both Powell Mason  Hyde and California cable car lines. My only criticism is that the rooms are a little small and you can find yourself falling over your bags.</text>

		<text>Great hotel! I really enjoyed my stay at the Barcelo Hotel Sants. I spent a week there and if you're looking for moderatly priced accommodation in an excellent location, i would thoroughly recommend you stay here. Location, service, rooms were all excellent. I have to say that i did find the breakfast fairly expensive (approx 11 euro), although you do get a discount rate if staying in the hotel. Definately very good value and well worth the stay!!!</text>

		<text>Great location! Great location base from which to explore Amsterdam. Basic amenities, but that was all we needed for a City break. Rooms were clean and serviced, breakfast was provided and there was plenty to fill up on. For the price we paid it was a great value for money and the reception staff were very helpful in answering questions, booking taxis etc. The only grumble was that there was a lot of noise in the night due to other guests coming back late!</text>

		<text>Quality hotel at reasonable prices - recommended I stayed in the hotel on the first weekend in February with friends who were celebrating a wedding. Found the hootel to be spotlessly clean, convenient for the underground and most of the sites, the staff were very friendly and all spoke good English. I only ate there at breakfast, but this was excellent with lots of choice and good serving times. The bar was lively in the evening and the barmen were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The receptionists also helped to locate traditional German food and everyone enjoyed the hospitality of our hosts. It was my first visit to Berlin, but I will definitely be going again and will stay at the Movenpick.</text>

		<text>Very bad place We stayed at the hotel in two days from the 12of dec. to the 14of dec. 2008. The hotel are run down, the room are smelly and dirty, and the staff are not very helpfully at all. Eating breakfast at the hotel is expencive and you are still hungry after, because of the very small portions. We where gratefull that we only had to spent two days there, before going to Miami port for a seven days cruise with the beautifull ship Freedom of the Seas. Never again the Marseilles Hotel.</text>

		<text>Great little hotel I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona and this hotel was great for my stay. The location is amazing, literally 2 minutes walk from La Rambla, a lot of people say this area is dodgy but as long as you don't walk around on your own it's fine and I never felt under threat going out for dinner at night, just try to stick to the busier roads rather than the small alleys. The hotel was extremely basic but clean which is the most important thing. We had a well equipped bathroom, a TV and a mini bar apart from tea making faciliites there was nothing more we needed. The staff are very helpful too. If you're looking for a budget hotel in Barcelona then this is a great option.</text>

It is also pretty quiet, considering how close it is to the centre of town. The only food I tried here was breakfast and that too was good, but rather expensive. If eating outside, however, be on your guard - those seagulls can move fast!</text>

		<text>Worst Hotel Stay... Ever!! We stayed here for the weekend to celebrate a bachelorette party. When we got to our room the door was wide open, our room key didn't work so we had to reactivate it every time we wanted to get back in, the floors were dirty, we didn't have enough beds to accodomate the girls, our window was broken with 90 degree hot air seeping in, no curtains to shade the room, and our bathroom light was broken! The hotel staff was rude and don't believe the pictures they show on their website, it looks nothing like that. Not worth the money at all, luckily after all our complaining we got our second night free!</text>

Factor in the friendly staff and good location with a very reasonable price and you have a smart selection for the budget traveller (but not too budget!).Lots of tourist sites, a plethora of restaurants and shopping areas within walking distance from this hotel. This is a solid choice for those who don鈥檛 need a four-star accommodation, but still want a well-kept, comfortable and centrally-located hotel.</text>

While the building is older, worn, and was never fancy to begin with; the rooms are big, comfortable, and in a perfect location. The service we received from the entire staff was very friendly and the best customer service any of us had ever experienced.

The beach is supurb (Like the bounty advert) lovely warm sea,very safe to wonder around,plenty of sun loungers,and parasoles for shade,the food is very good plenty of choice, breezes is a very clean and kept clean hotel the staff are very pleasent and very helpful,We would recommend taking a box of PG tips and a couple of bars of Cadburys and any other required pleasures, that can't be bought out there,you will be ripped off buying things in the hotel. The country side is very plush and green breath taking scenery and well worth taking an excursion out and experiencing the local culture. To sum up we had the most wonderful time and highly recommend a visit. Love Ness+John x.</text>

The location is very close to the Eiffel Tower as well as many museums, etc. We had a 5th floor room with a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. There is complimentary coffee/tea in the room, and there are washcloths. While the room wasn't large and needs updating, it was more than adequate for us.</text>

		<text>very pleasant stay Stayed here from 8th April for 3 nights and had a very enjoyable stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The ooms were nice if a tad smaller than we are used to and the absence of a bath was a disappointment having said that the were nicely decorated with modern furnishings and a flat screen TV.The hotel is in a quiet location about 15 minutes walk to the Placa Catalunya or 2 minutes to the Rocaforte Metro stop (and then 5 minutes on the L3 line to the Pl. Catalunya)We did find the breakfast room a bit of a crush but the food was adequate and frequently replenished.</text>

I would like to personally thank Concierge Kary and Carolina in working patiently with us in trying to locate our lost luggage (airlines fault). Their professionalism and kindness helped keep our stress to a minimum. To their credit, they had to help several guests who experienced the same situation and they always had a smile for each guest.</text>

		<text>Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5, 2005. It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10:20 p.m. on the night of Saturday 2nd. It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night. I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me. I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night. Luckily the security latch was on the door and the intruder could not enter.</text>

		<text>Great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here over New Year for 3 nights and it is one of the best hotels we have stopped in. The service and attention to detail is amazing. If you get the chance, book an executive room as this gives you access to the exec lounge where there is a complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails and canapes in the evening. It was worth every penny!</text>

		<text>Not your average hotel room I've stayed at this hotel twice, the first time with a group of girls for our friend's bachelorette party. The location was great, the staff was fine (though, admittedly, we were not that demanding of them), and the suite was huge. Also, we like the '50s/'60s-era feel and the fact that we weren't in another cookie-cutter chain. The location is also wonderful. I look forward to my next trip back to the Magic Castle.</text>

		<text>An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us. It was great to be able to walk off the Ramblas straight into the hotel, where peace and tranquillity was the order. The staff were both courteous and efficient and the bar service was excellent. Some may consider the rooms on the small side, but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair, you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer. I have recommended the hotel to both family and friends and will definately stay here again on our next visit.</text>

When our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hostal at 2am, we were welcomed in and shown to our room which was exactly as stated on their website. The rooms were clean and secure with extra conveniences such as a hair dryer, safe, patio and a decent sized bathroom. Very central location with fabulous bars and restaurants nearby.

		<text>average at best This hotel has a good location, but not a lot else, it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room, including giving us the key to an occupied room, and keys that did not work. We were then allegedly upgraded, from what I cannot imagine, the room was tiny, and not air conditioned. The continental breakfast was a complete farce, a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom, which had then to be carried back to the bedroom, where there was no where to eat but on the bed. The staff apart from the initial difficulties were pleasant and helpfull, and the hotel seemed clean.</text>

		<text>Disappointing and watch the final bill I've stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated (given the price) I've returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it. I wouldn't return to The Clift; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge/front door staff are all good but that's about it. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen (and I had a loft suite) - and for the price other hotels offer more (no flat screen TV, ineffective air con). What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US$185 for late checkout without any notification (I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11.00am). E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation.</text>

This is not a luxury hotel, but given the price we had no complaints. The street is a quiet one and the location, near the Duomo and on the same street as La Giostra Restaurant is very convenient. Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with, graciously providing information and making reservations for us for dinners and tours. The breakfast was very good and the dining room cheerful.</text>

Restaurant, poolbar and front desk staff were friendly and helpful. What I really appreciated:5mins walk from Mozaic (must be the best restaurant in Bali)Pool is a good length could be 25metresFree transfers to town from morning to nightResort is lush and green with lots of plants  flowersComo shambhala toiletriesNo major issues with the hotel except that there were flies by the poolside, which makes it inconvenient if you want to leave your food /drink unguarded while you take a dip.</text>

We were upgraded to one of the new apartments which was great and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is very good and the light snacks in the roof bar are excellent - plus the open terrace is a great location to sit and have a glass of wine and admire the view.

		<text>Clean Room / Great Location / Excellent Price I was entirely satisfied with my stay at the Prince Conti. I was shocked to find a safe and clean room at a price as low as the Prince Conti's midweek rates. While the hotel may lack some of the amenities of the 5-star New Orleans hotels, it is still an ideal place to catch your breath before heading back out to the Quarter or the Faubourg Marigny. It is clean, comfortable, and affordable.</text>

This kind of service attitude is simply not acceptable anywhere, let alone a hotel of this level. If you are going to compete with the rest at this category, make sure your first interface with clients is not this rude and short sighted.</text>

		<text>&gt;Sleep on a cloud This is my second stay at the Angeleno Hotel in Brentwood. While the rooms are ok for a stylish hotel, it is the bed and bedding that makes staying here a pleasure. The linen is soft and the mattress and duvet cover are heavenly. The hotel staff is courteous and helpful and room service is prompt.</text>

		<text>Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september. Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF, we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel. It presents itself as a cute boutique hotel which is how it looks on the website, however the reality is not. Room was tiny, deco was average, cleaning was it is minimum levels. It depends what you are looking for in yuor trip but don't expect to stay in a real boutique hotel, you will be disappointed as we were.</text>

		<text>Not more than ok Spent 3 nights at this motel early July. Rooms ok, clean but rather small and without a wardrobe to hang clothes. We were travelling for a month and had 3 suitcases for which we hardly found space in the room. Fridge and micro stuffed into the room, no place to eat except in bed. Similar to another review, we also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude from the owners, demanding our credit card for security even if the stay was prepaid through Expedia, and it was also not the place for asking questions. Location ok, a bit far down on Lombard Street but as Norwegians we're used to walking.</text>

		<text>Great hotel Just got back from a 4 night stay at this hotel, which I thoroughly recommend. The room was lovely, really big and with added extras such as free aveda toiletries, a well-stocked mini bar and a pillow menu, so you can choose the pillow that suits you and your needs best! And the club room on the 2nd floor is well worth taking advantage of, with big comfy leather sofas, a huge TV and free tea, coffee and water at all times and best of all - free wine and cheese Monday-Thursday between 6pm and 7pm! The staff were also great, really friendly and helpful. The location is good, between third and Lex with a subway station within a block and Grand Central a short walk away, and it is within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants all down second and third avenues. I would stay here again.</text>

		<text>p notch in the capital Our stay at Hotel 41 was a delight, from the time we walked in the front entrance to our departure. All the staff were very polite, attentive and seemed to take genuine pleasure in meeting all our needs and indeed, exceeding our expectations with all the special touches that made our stay memorable. The rooms were of the highest standard and the attention to detail in ensuring our comfort was delightful. We went to celebrate my fortieth birthday and will remember hotel 41 for all the right reasons for many years to come. We wil definately be returning in the future and have no hesitation in recommending this haven to others!</text>

		<text>Beautiful and quiet The Library is a beautiful, clean, lovely hotel in a great location. The staff from arrival until we left 4 days later were attentive, knowledgable, and helpful. The rooms are numbered with the Dewey Decimal System and each room has a little theme (ours was a the ancient language room) and they are tastefully decorated to create a calm inviting setting. They have complementary breakfast, drinks and snacks through out the day, complimentary wine and cheese daily, a rooftop bar, streetlevel resturaunt, oncall doctor, free movie rentals, and are within walking distance to 5th Avenue shopping, Grand Central Station, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. We are thankful to have found this place!</text>

We have stayed in some impressive four star hotels in other US cities but are really glad we acted on the reviews to book into The Casablanca for our first trip to New York. The well decorated rooms are not huge and the views nothing special but , that said, for staff, location, cleanliness, Rick's Lounge and overall ambience this hotel is tops.</text>

		<text>agree with &quot;do not stay here&quot; This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn't give it two. A hint to future guests: if you have a problem, it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations. They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it. They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns. Save yourself the pain and get yourself a real four star hotel and stay at the Best Western down the street.</text>

Overall service was OK, although there was a hick-up, but the people from the restaurant restored that. Very negative: the beds: too soft!!! Also when you stay in a room you think at night that someone is breaking into your room, but it's just your neighbor that is entering his/her room.</text>

Upstairs concierge(s) do not say hello, used the speaker phone to talk to the returns department at Macy's (spare me!) my request for missing newspaper was answered with it'll get here.

		<text>Great hotel, but not so great location The hotel is very modern, with an air of trendiness, the furniture is new and very nice, the bathroom is large, well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny. On the other hand, some things are a little kitchy, like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room (first I thought it's parquet), the breakfast is really poor, the parking a little too expensive (15 euros a day) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying. The hotel is near the train station, but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room. Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls. It takes about 15 minutes to the center.</text>

		<text>Great Hotel, no Monkey Bar This is a wonderful hotel that is similar to many classy European hotels. The room (76) was elegant and clean, and the location was perfect. The only negative aspects of our stay were the construction across the street (noise) and the fact that the Monkey Bar was closed for renovation (no mention of this on the hotel website). If you stay here...ask for a room away from the street to avoid the construction noise.</text>

		<text>very nice airport hotel Was very pleased with this hotel. Rooms are very large, well appoingted but with plenty of space for luggage etc. Breakfast was more than adequate, with made-to-order omelets, and the whole facility was immaculate and actually worked! Only negatives we noted were shuttle service from LAX is on request which we didn't know and lost some time waiting curbside before calling, and if you rent a car or drive, note that hotel parking is $15.00 per nite. Since it is very close to the airport the aircraft noise might bother light sleepers/children.</text>

It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin (its very cheap, efficient and easy to navigate) but the area was no problem - I guess it's worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are. I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price, venue and facilities (breakfast, spa, small bar, minibar, bikes available and outside seating). Stay here!!</text>

		<text>Sufficient I wouldn't necessarily go back to the Hostal R. Capitol, as I found it a bit old and crumbly for my taste, but it has a couple of redeeming qualities: First, it is located right on the Ramblas, and there's hardly a more perfect location for those who enjoy bustling activity in their immediate environs. Second, I was extremely grateful that I was able to book the room shortly before 10:30 on a Friday night, arrive about an hour later ... and check out around 5:30 the following morning. The helpful gentleman at the front desk, on duty all night long, was undaunted by the unusual (but, in my case, necessary) hours. In short, this would not be my first choice for Barcelona accomodations, but if you need an inexpensive room in a pinch, Hostal R. Capitol suffices.</text>

		<text>Lovely hotel in convenient location This hotel is conveniently located to the train station and all the key sites. We walked every where. The hotel and breakfast room were lovely. If noise is a problem, definitely ask for a room away from the street. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are lovely as are the baths and the amenities. I would stay here again.</text>

		<text>A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $34 dollars a day. I may have been ok with this had I known, but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website. The manager was quick to show me where the charge was buried in the website rather than to come to some agreement since this was a suprise. Be careful when staying here..... there is a charge for just about everything including to use the gym.</text>

		<text>kimberley A-OK We stayed at the Kimberley Hotel at the last week of April. The room was clean,the bed linens crisp and the bathroom spotless. For the price we paid,this was a great deal!It's location was near to 7-11,and shopping galore along Nathan Rd, Cameron and Granville St.. Just near the hotel is a money exchange dealer who gave us a good deal for our U.S. dollars. The MTR stations were just a block away.all in all i would recomment this place to all.the room is rather small but for its price and strategic location, i can overlook that aspect.</text>

It's pretty bare-bones but I was very happy with what I got for the money. The family that runs the place is very friendly, and they gave me very helpful tips for shopping, car rental etc., so make sure to ask them if you plan to go out and buy anything.</text>

		<text>Great Customer Service... Stayed for two nights and was placed into the wrong room type on the first night due to 'overbooking'. This was not a bother as I was by myself for the first night. The next day the staff were extremely apologetic and moved me to a Hyde Park view room. Overall, very impressed with the service. The rooms were immaculate. Would definitely recommend this Hotel if you have some spare cash to spend on accommodation.</text>

		<text>Q We booked a four-night airfare/hotel package with Expedia,choosing the QC because of the mostly positive reviewson TripAdvisor.com, which turned out to be accurate. TheQ C will not knock your socks off, but it covers the basicbases handily: with a pleasant, clean room and a few pleasing extras like Bath and Body Works toiletries, a second magnifying mirror in the bathroom, etc. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. One drawback: we were put in the second building next door on Camp Street, and the room had permanently-sealed windows of frosted, pebbled glass -- gave kind of a claustrophobic effect.</text>

		<text>Recommended, but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online. I'm sure this hotel is fine for vacationers: the rooms are ok (especially the kitchenettes), the location is pretty good, and the staff are helpful. However, I don't recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer. The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm, and the wireless internet mostly non-existent (at least while I was staying). It just isn't worth it.</text>

		<text>Very good I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews on here - unless parts of the hotel are still being renovated. I stayed in the tower part which was very good - air conditioning was excellent which in Singapore is a must. The rooms are quite small (the bathroom especially), but otherwise a decent place to stay for a few days. There was a regular free bus into town, and it's only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay (about 30 mins to Orchard Road).Happily stay again, although as ever I do resent having to pay extra for the internet when you pay a fair whack for the room in the first place.</text>

		<text>Great hotel for a city break We stayed at the Residence Inn from 6-10 June 2008 for 4 nights. We had a 2 bed suite on the 14th floor which had everything you need even had large dishwasher and a huge fridge/freezer which came in handy for ice cream as there was an heatwave on whilst we were there. Could not fault it at all. Hotel is in a great location, plenty of resturants nearby , not too far to the train station. I think this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when doing a city break. Would definately recommend it.</text>

		<text>Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam. We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer. The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden, which was perfectly nice and quiet. Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East, for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional, something you don't see everywhere. Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well (which we didnt join since we had other plans).Staff, especially porters and concierge, were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans, which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay. All in all, the location can't be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff, Pulitzer gets a thumb up!</text>

		<text>Stylish and great staff I stayed at the Hotel Globus in May 2005 as a single female traveller. The room was small but very stylish and spotless. The staff were all fantastic and very friendly. Good breakfast and excellent location for the railway station and easy reach of all Florence's attractions. I'm going back to Florence in December and will be staying there again.</text>

		<text>really disappointed I can not believe this hotel has such rating stay away from it, I think it deserve one star the most. The service is really bad and not to mention things disappear from your room and their respond is we are investigating it, they charge you for compelementry coffee, and it takes them five hours to get you a taxi to the air port. Bottom line very expensive for the service for the same money you can get a real 5 star hotel. Trust me stay away. Anti american.</text>

		<text>Lovely hotel I wanted a great hotel in Amsterdam with a pool for a leisure stay. The Amstel was the most fantastic place to stay; cost an arm and a leg but worth it if you can afford it. Great room, food, service, nothing at all to complain about. I was a little worried about the distance from the centre of Amsterdam but needn't have been - the trams are fast and frequent and even to walk isn't that bad. Would highly recommend this hotel.</text>

Very nice room, nice view over the city, great location, nice restaurant, helpful employees... everything positive except maybe the swimming-pool that was a bit sad looking compared to the general impression given by the hotel. Worth the stay there!</text>

		<text>vercharged at check out! The hotel room was fine, rather small but ok. What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate. Of course at check out, they upped my rate even after I reminded them and they assured that I was getting the the lower rate but charged my credit card more. I traveled throughout Europe and this was the only hotel that charged me a higher rate. I would probably not return.</text>

The hotel was probally cool a few years ago but is now looking old and tired. Staff are helpful but no room service or help with your bags.

		<text>Lovely boutique hotel The Hotel Ares Eiffel was renovated a few months ago and has been done very tastefully. Some of the previous reviewer photos are a bit old and not at all representative of the current state. The room we stayed in (executive) was very nice. It's reasonably expensive but bearing in mind the location and that this is Paris, probably about right. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a very nice boutique hotel!</text>

		<text>Great location My husband and i have just spent three nights in this hotel. It is ideally situated to see all the main sights as it is right across the street from the train station and under ground, which I must say we found to be brilliant as they all seem to arrive on time. The hotel and the rooms are very clean. The staff are friendly and the concierge are excellent for information about the best way to get to sights. All in all an excellent trip and I would have no hesitation on recommending this hotel.</text>

We payed around 70 euro a night - and i was pleasently surprised. We had an enormous room, big comfy kingsize bed and a great shower. Couldn't ask for anymore really, about a 20 minute stroll to mitte and hackescher markt. A good value base in Berlin.</text>

		<text>Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel. When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip, we got a cancellation number. A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.</text>

Furthermore facing the street and canal you are assured of sleepless nights from all the party goers at nearby Rembrandtplein. We stayed at hotel Pita 2 years ago and although not as central as Seven bridges at least we were able to sleep at night.</text>

When returned to UK appeared to have been charged the wrong amount to our credit card - tried to sort out by email but are insisting we write to them if we want a copy of our account -not hugely convenient when you live on the other side of the world. hope to get this sorted out as appear to have been significantly overcharged and if we can't sort it would not stay here again.</text>

We booked a Superior room for 5 nights and had a fantastic stay. Lucie was very helpful and the room was spotless 鈥?they were just renovated. We enjoyed the balcony and, an added bonus, the subway station was just near the hotel so travelling in Paris was amazingly. Altogether great accommodation in a wonderful location.</text>

		<text>Great Hotel ,perfect location I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni and really if you want an excellent hotel in a great location this has to be your choice. The rooms are of a good size with large bathrooms and a walk in shower, i had a premier room which was an upgrade from a deluxe room which i paid for ,to recieve this uprade sign up to Omni Hotels signature program and you will recieve this for free as well as other benefits such as late check out. As all the other reviews state the staff are excellent, i travelled with my 2 year old daughter and all the staff made a fuss of her. As far as location goes to me this is in the best location in the city union square shopping is 10 mins walk in one direction and fishermans walf 20 mins in the other and north beach and chinatown on your doorstep, although there are plenty of buses ,cable cars and taxis if you want to take it easy. I booked with hotel connect a uk website which were 拢400 cheaper on my booking than any other website. Room service is expensive but breakfast in you room is nice, go on treat yourself ,your on holiday.</text>

When I had to change dates at the last minute due to plane problems, the hotel was extremely accommodating. The staff was very helpful and always cheerful during my stay. The hotel is only a block from several great restaurants and a three block walk from Union Square and all the shopping you could want. The price is a bit steep, but the clean and comfortable room with a 42 HDTV made up for it.</text>

		<text>Not at all what is used to be This once was a nice hotel which has gone for the cheapercrowd, tatoo people, Mom Dad 3 kids in a room type deal + events. Way too small to handle both conferences and wedding events on the same day along with family outings. This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences, cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd, and weddings anyday of the week which means: bottom line the facilities are not available 24/7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard. What was once a $400 night hotel for the business, elite traveler is now a $49-79night cheap 4 star; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline, this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed. Very crowded, very low class. We had business guests with written reservations well in advance, two were bumped out of the hotel; we were treated rudely, pulled our corporate account.</text>

		<text>Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont. We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite, we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money, the rooms are huge. We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river. I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had, however, on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill. A lovely hotel in a great location and if we visit New York again we would not hesitate to stay here.</text>

		<text>Nice hotel, uninteresting location This hotel itself and the staff are very adequate but being located in downtown Miami is a hinderance. It is far from the beaches and its pool and health facilities are very small, considering it is in Florida. The surrounding area is undergoing a great deal of building and renovation so currently it is noisy; I am sure it will improve in the next few years. Overall a good hotel for business meetings but not for vacationers.</text>

		<text>mfortable and well equipped Great location for exploring the latin quarter and St Germain, but still an easy walk into the centre of Paris. We just used it as a crash pad, so were barely here. Excellent double glazing and a quiet side street location. Super clean and good facilities. Compact room, but what do you expect in a big city hotel!</text>

		<text>Great for our family of 5 Great hotel for family! We spent four nights at the Ilikai with our 3 sons, ages 15, 12 and 8. It was away from the hustle and bustle of the main part of Waikiki Beach, but right next door the the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We had an ocean view room with 2 dbls, 1 sofabed and kitchette. Wonderful views and close to a big beach.</text>

		<text>They won us over We weren't sure about this hotel at first - it needs a bit of TLC and a lick of paint in some areas, but the staff made it for us. We didn't see one rude member of staff - all were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is extremely well located and being on the fourth floor we didn't hear any noise at all - even though Barcelona had just won the league and the streets were alive with cheering mobs of football fans when we arrived! I would definately stay here again.</text>

We only have a few days so we wanted to quickly arrange some trips - but the extremely unfriendly receptionist has flatly refused to help us, or even let us use the phone to call the tour companies. We have no phone, the internet is too slow, so we're now setting off to macy's third floor to find a payphone. I am speechless!!</text>

		<text>Great Petit Hotel, Superb location! Very nice hotel, in the very center of florence, the street on which it resides is the street that goes from the duomo to the ponte vecchio, right in the middle of those 2 attractions and just 1 block away form the piazza de la republicca. Great fares! Service is very nice, views are amazing. The only thing I would improve is room size though... I extremely recommend this hotel!</text>

The location near Union Square is extremely convenient for shopping around the Square and in the excellent Westfield Centre, the cable cars along Powell towards Fisherman's Wharf and Muni along Market towards Embarcadero. The staff were friendly and efficient providing information, printing out boarding passes, storing luggage and providing a town car to the airport.

I would estimate there were over 20 to 30 ants on the floor at one time. Telling the front desk attendant about the ants, she seem unconcerned and was suprised this was an issue. Having no other rooms we checked-out and were not charged.</text>

		<text>Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away</text>

		<text>A Very Special Place I had done a lot of research into hotels in Venice and with the help of the reviews on tripadvisor I booked my girlfriend and I into the Hotel Al Ponte. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and can honestly say that it was one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The rooms were extremely clean and very comfortable. The hosts we helpful and attentive at all times without being pushy!!!The location of this hotel is brilliant, close to everything yet far enough away to enjoy a walk through the streets of Venice to the main sights. I would recommend the hotel to anyone and its value for money is an added bonusThank you to Walter, Sandro and their staff</text>

		<text>Stayed at the Kimberly June 24-27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr, 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6. They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable, pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location, nice doormen, and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we'd stay again -</text>

		<text>New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.</text>

		<text>ideal location excellent location, not knowing the city, we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area, pier 39 , the deals, alcatraz. The hotel was very plush inside, staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile. Our room was fantatic, modern clean and decorated to a very high standard. The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn't get to appreciate the facilities. Would suggest this hotel used if time to be spent relaxing within the hotel, if a hotel needed to use as a base for sightseeing then maybe this one is a little too expensive.</text>

		<text>#4 Hotel in Los Angeles??? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights. Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms. Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like. The carpeting was stained, there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub. Granted the location is good, however if I knew that the rooms looked like this I would have gone to the Roosevelt.</text>

		<text>we like the St Francis This is a lovely hotel with a sense ot charm and history. However it is a bit dated in places, (corridors and rooms), however it is really in a great location, right overlooking Union Square, right in the midst of it all, and close to shops, restaurants etc. we were on our honey moon so they gave us a special room which was really quite big and nicely furnished. the champagne mojitos in the bar were pretty excellent too.</text>

		<text>The staff make this hotel truly awesome! We decided to visit the wonderful island of Bali for our Honeymoon in October and after scouring the internet for the best all inclusive resorts there chose to stay at the Melia Benoa hotel. The staff at the hotel were simply superb; Mendrin, Pardi and Augustini were the highlights providing service with a smile 24/7! Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front, with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants. Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options, imported spirits, late check out and free laundry service!Also had a good tour of the island with Wayan - recommended although don't forget to take extra cash to buy souvenirs and to get into the tourist attractions!</text>

		<text>EXCELLENT!! Stayed on a two night break and it was excellent!Staff very helpful and fluent in English - bar staff also brilliant (thoroughly enjoyed the snacks put out to enjoy with your drinks in the bar downstairs).Rooms were amazing and definately have a 'wow' factor. Staff recommended excellent local restaurants to eat in and found walking to them and the touristy places very easy. I would really recommend this, and have done, to everyone.</text>

		<text>fabulous! We arrived at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne with high expectations, which could have really set us up for a disappointment. Fortunately, we were even more impressed than we thought we would be. The staff was very helpful, always smiling, and the room was wonderfully clean, with a distant view of the Sacre Coeur from the balcony (on the fourth floor). It is close to the pyramides metro station, so it's easy to navigate the city from its location. I'm not sure that I will choose a pricier hotel in Paris, because this hotel has so much to offer--all the more reason to splurge on some fantastic French food!</text>

		<text>A Very Good Hotel at a Very Good Price This was a very good surprise in Madrid: The rate was extremely good (90 euros/night, booked about 2 months in advance); included internet, minibar complimentary; was Exceptionally Clean; Recently renovated; Quiet; Well located (short cab ride or walk to Prado in one direction; Mayor Square in the other); very friendly. I was extremely happy with this hotel and would recommend it if you're looking for a smaller hotel that is quiet and well located. Note, it did not have exercise facilities and the on site restaurant was pricey; however, eating options were readily available at a number of restaurants within 1 to 3 minute walk.</text>

		<text>Good hotel - but watch your wallet This hotel has character and is in an excellent location. The restaurant is very good - reasonable prices, huge menu, very popular. Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned. Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street. Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room. The hotel (and cleaner) were no doubt banking (correctly) that we wouldn't bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station!</text>

		<text>lean and good location but aimed at gay community. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but small. We believe they cater for a gay market, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.</text>

		<text>zy This hotel may appear old and run down from the outside but I found it quant, clean, and roomy on the inside. I rented a room that had a bathroom. The room had room and even though the building was older it was clean. The was location was great, (2 blocks from Pikes Place).I stayed for 3 nights. My only complaints were thin walls, (you could hear chatter next door even when others were using speaking voices), and one night were the neighbors liked to party late.</text>

		<text>Great Hotel, Great location Travelled with my wife and two friends to New York to see the St Patricks day parade. We found the staff very helpful and pleasant. Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed!!We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great. For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast, be early it gets very busy. The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk. Ps Do the circle line boat tour to see the statue of liberty and the new york skyline it is fantastic.</text>

The location is nearly unbeatable. The view from canal-side rooms is unbeatable. The rooms are charming, spotless and spacious. The price was right. I have paid a lot more for standard Amsterdam charmless fare, but I won't again.</text>

		<text>Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years. An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff. Great location in Midtown on the East Side, close to restaurants, shopping and an easy walk, cab or subway ride to museums. Highly recommended especially if you can find a good deal online either through the hotel itself or an online travel agency. My only complaint is the high prices for room service and still a $10 per day charge for high speed internet.</text>

		<text>Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of. Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation, the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel, which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare. We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn't get much satisfaction. I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service. We will not be going back there.</text>

Coast appears to have undergone a recent remodel, and the did an excellent job. Located on International Blvd and next to the airport I was surprized to find that neither the street noise nor air-traffic were loud. Several nearby restuarants, and the hotel had a very good free breakfast.</text>

		<text>wonderful hotel We stayed for 4 nights at the Argonaut - our second stay here. The hotel's location at the end of Fisherman's Wharf and almost next to Ghirardelli Square is just about perfect for vacationing travelers - very convenient, yet quiet. Service is excellent, beds are extremely comfortable, and rooms are well decorated and clean. The hotel's restaurant, Blue Mermaid, is very good (although we liked Capurro's across the street better for breakfast). The bowls of fruit in the lobby and the wine hour in the afternoon are great added touches that make you feel good that you decided to stay there.</text>

The modernisation has ben done thoughtfully with old features retained but clean, spacious modern rooms. The staff were helpful and the hotel was great as a base to explore the city. I did not eat in the hotel - there were too many tempting local restaurants nearby - but the bar was stylish and welcoming.

After relying on Trip Advisor (once again) we booked a 4-day stay at Iberville Suites and could not have been more pleased, The location is perfect - 1 block from Bourbon Street and all the action - but the QUIETEST hotel we have ever stayed in! All of the employees we came in contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fine - but of course one day you'll want to go to Cafe Dumond for those amazing beignets. The rooms are very, very clean and it truly is a suite - separate sitting area, 2 TVs, etc. We would most definitely return.</text>

		<text>great location This is a very clean and comfortable hotel right in the center of Madrid. The bathroom was very nice for European standards. Most Spanish hotels I've stayed in do not offer double beds, this is no exception. The breakfast is nice, but not a bargain. I would definitely stay here again.</text>

		<text>pretty standard, good location Me and my wife stayed at Coral Princess Inn on November 2005. The hotel has a very good location and the area is quiet and decent. We are not the type of people to whine about the change of sheets and spots on the walls, but there seemed to be a major problem with their air conditioning at the room we were staying in. We got that little room no 12 for 99 USD per night on the second floor. The temperature in the room was never under 32 degrees celcius and we found it hard to sleep sometimes.</text>

		<text>Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location, that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar, and the rudness of the people at the front desk. Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise, and when you only need five minutes to get to any place, you forget the rudness of the front desk staff. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was ok, and remember this, if is clean and has a great location, the restis not important. Will definitely come back here. They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm, with very good food.</text>

		<text>Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris, I was concerned to choose well. After reading several reviews on the internet, I selected the Hotel D'Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice. The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was 'at the heart' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme, Louvre, Pompidou Centre, Pantheon etc. The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright, clean, and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate. All in all, the Hotel D'Albe surpassed all our expectations, and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit. Terry  Chris (Devon, England)</text>

		<text>Great Location The location of this hotel really couldn't be better - 5 minutes from the Prudential Centre and a metro stop. We stayed here for 2 nights and found the room comfortable and a good size. The room was a little dated but clean. My only complaint would be that the air conditioning is very noisy - you can hear the corridor one all the time. Saying this it certainly didn't keep me awake at night.</text>

		<text>Great Hotel Consistent Service, Not a Good Location Have stayed here a few times for business, and this hotel never disappoints. courtyard, pool and spa are an oasis in this concrete jungle. Rooms area clean and consistent and up to four seasons standards. Hotel not located in the best area of the city, and I would not recommend walking outside, even though there is a park closeby. Hotel is located in an area with alot of one way stalled traffic, so a real pain to get in and out of the hotel if you are trying to get to meetings or the airport to catch a flight.</text>

		<text>A nice, affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona, but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price. Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord, you can't stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona's top sights. Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street. Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room, and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early (9:30ish) in the morning. Otherwise, this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city.</text>

Don't expect to view the skyline as the hotel is not very tall and it's surrounded by offices.</text>

		<text>Great hotel, great service, great location! My family of four, including two teenage boys stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is excellent, the rooms, although fairly small, were certainly big enough for the four of us and were well maintained and very nicely decorated. We received very good service and would definitely stay there again if we return to Boston. Everyone, including the desk clerk, concierge, door man, and housekeeping staff were friendly as well as helpful. I have no complaints and would highly recommend the Boston Park Plaza.</text>

		<text>Excellent service I stayed at the Radisson as one of a group of 40 that travelled to Boston for the St. Patricks day parade. I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel facillities are really good, including on site swimming pool, rooms are above average size, excellent beds, spotlessly clean, restaurant is well above average and hotel is very centrally located and convienient to airport (12 mins by cab) The reservations dept were extremely helpful throughout and were not in the least fazed by the inevitable changes to bookings that is inherrent in a large group. In short, highly recommended and would definately stay there again when in Boston.</text>

		<text>Still my favourite - but... This is definately my favourite hotel in Paris (considering my budget).Great location, friendly staff, surprising design features, nice rooms, clever lay out, but... we were lucky. Friends travelling with us stayed in the same hotel, at the same rate but didn't really get what we got. They walked into a really tiny and a little run down room, and the bathroom was very tiny and didn't 'feel' clean. So picking this hotel is like playing the lottery. You can get lucky - like we did, or you can be less lucky like our friends.</text>

		<text>Big rooms, near the night-life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise. Very well-located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well-decorated. Service is good-enough and the stairs (there's no elevator) can be scary if you have big suitcases. Very good deal, specially for young couples. It can be a little noisy at night due the bars around, but nothing that bothers too much.</text>

		<text>Ideal For Long Weekend First impressions of the hotel were excellent. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff who were keen to ensure that our stay in the hotel and Barcelona was as pleasant as possible. Our room was large, if basic, with a good standard of cleanliness. Due to the tiled floors the noise from corridors did tend to echo in our room however, this was not a particular problem that would put us off returning to the hotel in the future. The location is ideal for the tourist with limited time, very close to the centre but situated away from the noise of the main thoroughfare.</text>

		<text>Not a bad pllace to stay We needed a fairly inexpensive place near the Quarter and found the Courtyard. We arrived not knowing what to expect. While it was not luxurious it was clean, the pool/courtyard area were fantastic and easy to get to, and the staff was friendly and bent over backwards to help make our stay enjoyable. No matter where your room is, you are close to street level and traffic could be noisy at night. The continental breakfast was small, but it was available all morning long and the coffee was great! While it's not the Ritz, it's not a bad place to stay.</text>

		<text>Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24/7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino, but the rooms themselves are a little tired. That said, they're still well equipped - the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in had everything we needed, except for the absolute lack of patio furniture. Beds were clean and comfy, and the lounge room was roomy. The hotel is starting to show its age though, and the standard prices are several times what they should be. If you want to stay somewhere nice and central (and open around the clock), check out local hotel websites in advance and you should be able to score a room here at half the price or less.</text>

From the welcoming reception, cookies and apples in the lobby, upscale furniture and the cutest open courtyard with bistro sets this hotel does it right. The decor in the room, fluffy towels, above average bathroom accessories and a fridge, bottled water is everything you need. Great location from the pier and no problems at all with noise.

		<text>Absolutely terrible! We stayed here in August 2006 and this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at. The rooms, furniture and appliances were so old that we thought we were in a motel off of a small highway. The food was so-so but the restaurant service was absolutely terrible. We were absolutely unimpressed!</text>

		<text>A Wonderful Hotel We stayed for four nights in room number 4 and loved it. The room held up to our expectations from the photos on the hotel's website, it was beautifully furnished with antiques, expensive carpets and curtains. The room was very cosy and had a wonderful atmosphere so that we enjoyed every minute we spent in it. The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional and the location of the hotel was superb.</text>

		<text>Excellent room and service The room was excellent, and the staff very friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. They also arranged a doctor to visit the hotel to see our young daugther, and then also interpreted. My only observation is that you probably don't need to book a canal room as there's not a huge amount to see out of the windows. You'll enjoy the stay</text>

		<text>Great Deal! Got a great deal at the Marinna Inn. The location was nice, the hotel clean, friendly and problem free. We had a room on the street and the noise didn't bother us a bit - but we are used to downtown living. I would recommend for anyone on a budget.</text>

		<text>l location I stayed a couple of days in NYC on my way home from the West Coast. I picked the Sofitel based on the TripAdvisor reviews and the Internet rates they were offering. I really enjoyed the location, the hotel is great (nice lobby, stylish rooms, good concierge service, etc). The only thing I didn't like (while staying at the 12th floor) is the view - there was none - only a back street. If you can find a good rate, I can only recommend this hotel.</text>

		<text>We had our things STOLEN in our room The hotel was aweful, the room door a joke. We had merely arrived and left the hotel room for only one hour to have diner. When we got back, somebody had broken into our room (307) and had stolen our camera, phone, mp3 player, among other things. AVOID THIS HOTEL, even if it is the last available room in the whole of Barcelona.</text>

		<text>Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and although we did have some minor troubles (check in delayed by half an hour, water pressure) the staff of the hotel and the manager in particular demonstrated great understanding and excellent customer service. Interiors are very well designed, minimal being the key word. I'd go back there as the location is perfect, we walked everywhere and didn't need to take the tube at all! One highlight: the breakfast! Eating out in Barcelona can be pretty pricey so the huge buffet with savory and sweet choices, cooked brekfast with tortillas, eggs, bacon, etc is definitely worth it!</text>

		<text>ral location Having to go to Manhatten on business, our corporate booked us at this hotel. At the last minute we had to get an additional night and the staff did a great job. The location and experience of the staff made a traveler new to New York really feel at ease. Though not the most modern, this is by no means a shabby hotel.

		<text>Once is enough If this is a 5-star hotel, I'm a monkey's uncle! I'll give it 3-stars on a good day. The rooms are dated although ours was good sized and with a nice view over the Dam. Staff were not necessarily rude, but useless and incompetent at best, although I think this was simply because the staff just did not care. Got a good deal on the internet, but wish I would've paid more and gone somewhere else.</text>

The staff will speak English if you do and will speak French if you do, even if you speak poorly. The Amex bill will floor you on return, but there is no better place to stay in Paris.

		<text>Great hotel, good value for money This hotel is close to the main train station of Florence, approx 5 mins walk and about 10 -15 mins to main city centre. We were pleasantly surprised by our room, the high ceiling had lovely wooden beams and the room was spacious. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was ok - we didn't bother getting up for it after the first morning!There are several good restaurants within walking distance and all the main tourist attractions are close by. An extra benefit of the hotel is that they have free internet access which is great for that lastminute research or online check inIf you're looking for a hotel that is great value for money, then definitely go for this one!</text>

		<text>wonderful experience I love Bali very much, together with my husband and other couples, we always stayed in five star hotel. This time we want to spend in private villas instead. And we find Aston bhavana, perfecly located in prime area in Seminyak. we are very happy with this decision. The design is so cozy and the villas is so spacious, the ambience is so fresh, we could relax in our private pool, and having a chef cooked in our villas, the service is absolutely high end, we feel so special. This experience could never been forgotten.</text>

Yes, the rooms are as tiny as all the reviews say, but you can't beat the location. And really, how much time do you actually spend in the room. The hotel staff was courteous. Although the restaurant next door can't compete with San Francisco's finest, Annabelle's was great for a quick meal at the end of a long day.</text>

The food is ok but repetitive especially if you are staying for 14 days like we were.

It is a bit expensive but if you take into consideration that you get a good breakfast included, and free transportation on all the S bahns, U bahns and busses, it is worth it. You just go downstairs and the train station and the S Bahn is just down there. Also a mall with all kinds of restaurants and shops.</text>

		<text>Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest. Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty. Hair in sink and bath was off putting. Best measure of (lack of) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window. We were told someone would clean, then they would clean next day - needless to say it remained uncleaned on check out two days later. Location only good point.</text>

		<text>Very Good Stayed here for business in Brooklyn, the location was great, just a block from where I was working. Overall a great hotel, well maintained and very clean (especially when compared to previous experiences in 'upscale' Manhattan hotels).Food was very good, and restaurant/bar staff friendly. My only issue was with the noise from the adjacent room that came through the connecting door. This seems to be a common problem with Marriotts, in my experience (maybe with all hotels as well, but I stay almost exclusively at Marriotts.) A fussy toddler kept me awake until 1:30AM, ugh. Beautiful views from the Concierge Lounge, and presumably from bridge-view rooms.</text>

		<text>Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. Our room was a really good size and very comfortable. Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee, it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10:30am. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs, bacon, toast etc. We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again.</text>

The entire staff, from Timothy Lawrence, General Manager, to the bell men were more than pleasant and helpful. I would definitely choose to stay there again.</text>

		<text>Smiley's Restaurant We didn't stay at the hotel, but ate at the attached restaurant. It was, by far, the best meal we had in Rincon. The atmosphere is very romantic and the service was great. OUr meal took a little longer because of a big party and the waiter bought our drinks. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more romantic night out.</text>

		<text>Superb hotel We went to Berlin for the Xmas markets and decided to stay at this hotel because of the very good feedback reviews on tripadvisor. For the money, it is one of the best European hotels that we have stayed in - we were surprised at how large the rooms were. It is also ideally situated and in very quiet street. The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was not included in the price but we found a small cafe just around the corner where we could purchase rolls, sandwiches, croissants etc at a fraction of the price that the breakfast in the hotel would have cost. Thoroughly recommended - you won't be disappointed.</text>

Room excellent, staff excellent, facilities excellent, restaurant/bar excellent, reasonably priced, shuttle to airport excellent. If it were somewhere else it would get a 5!</text>

Still, even they were satisfied with the stay because they saved money and the location was ideal for our tastes. Really a wonderful hotel, but don't spare the expense.

		<text>Not bad Hotel was about 20-25 minute walk to the centre of Florence. The room was clean, with a good shower and the staff were friendly. The only downside were the banging of doors late at night and in the early hours from other guests 'coming and going'. It did get on your nerves after a while and stopped a good nights sleep. Probably wouldn't stay here again for that reason.</text>

		<text>Be Warned: Polyester Sheets First of all, this place is really really cheap, so I feel a little bad complaining, also the staff were genuinely concerned when i brought this matter to their attention,however, the sheets here are some kind of polyester blend, so even though it may be freezing cold outside, you will not need to turn on the heat, you will sweat up a storm and wake up wet. I didn't sleep too well once i realized i was sleeping on a mattress that must be drenched with the sweat of a thousand previous guests.i would not stay here again, even with it being cheap.</text>

I was in a distant section that made access to the lobby and conference section quite a hike but was near to the spa and pool which proved to be an advantage. The pool is immense and, as a swimmer, was most welcome. The food was tasty and well presented and the location was very convenient for access to lots of transportation and local activities.</text>

		<text>Encapsulates the heart of Florence We spent a few days here at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have picked a nicer spot. We fell in love with Florence and also with this hotel which, for us, encapsulated the heart of this beautiful city with its relaxed elegance and warm spirit. We had a very 'Florentine' room with a view' and a great bed, the best of friendly attention from our hosts, a good breakfast and a super location. In the grim early- winter days which are fast enveloping the North of Ireland, we think about our 'time out' in this little Florentine idyll all the time and hope some day to return. Thanks for everything.</text>

The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling. We realised that the breakfast charges of 330,000 R for breakfast for two was way over the top, and started visiting outside the resort. Everything works, it鈥檚 all nice, but it feels like nobody鈥檚 there, and its not fun.</text>

		<text>A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol. True--but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels' and it's a 20 euro cab ride. My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties--a reservation canceled without notice, a free wifi system that was down (a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords), a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks. This hotel is in a suburban business district--it may be very convenient and useful on workdays; my very short stay there, on a Saturday, after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip, was nothing but a series of frustrations.</text>

		<text>IDEAL for large groups. Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30's and 40's. Found it to be a good quality ,well run, clean hotel. Staff were all very curteous and welcoming (even when returning from nights out at 5.30AM) and rooms were clean and adequate. Didn't sample the food - plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars within 50 yards. Steps to (excellent) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport (get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T-10 ticket that allows 10 journeys).Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro's a day is a bit stiff.</text>

		<text>Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you'd go to if you want a really upscale, romantic place to stay. BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam. It's a two minute walk to the Dam Square, 10 minute walk to the Central Station and within easy walking distance of everything in central Amsterdam. The hotel is clean and quiet an comfortable, but I would say the key selling point is the fact that it is so well located.</text>

		<text>Great find - family hotel in the heart of New York City Found this hotel quite by accident and what a find... Location is just off times square - right in the middle of the action. Hotel is themed on North African theme and it completely works, the friendly attentitive staff actually seem to care about your well being and you don't feel as though you are a corporate number. In particular the free cheese and wine every evening helps to make you night out complete, they do this because they don't (didn't) have a liquor licence.breakfast is continental style - but again included in the price. The rooms are big (for New York) and a welcome change from the chain hotels - with fans as well as the usual AC. The only downside was leaving - great place.</text>

		<text>Pleasantly surprised! I stayed here over a weekend and paid a ridicously low rate, so I wasn't expecting much. The concierge was very helpful and the beautiful hotel bar is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine and listen to piano, or later in the night, the jazz quartet. My room was very large, my only complaint is the plumbing is still very old (it took a long time for the hot water). Otherwise this place is a gem and a nice change of pace from the cookie-cutter chains.</text>

		<text>A great value right next to the French Quarter I needed an alternate hotel near the Sheraton on Canal, where I was attending a conference. I found the Country Inn  Suites on Magazine Street to be reasonably priced, clean and convenient in location to my conference and to the French Quarter. The rooms are small, but the building is architecturally interesting as a combination of three older buildings that were remodeled into a hotel. The free breakfast buffet has a good selection as well. Overall, a good buy!</text>

		<text>Be wary! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc. However, I found there was some rather foul stains (females staying along do not make marks like that) on the duvet cover, which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc. Really not acceptable in a hotel aiming to be top tier and fairly disgusting. So check your bedsheets before climbing into bed there.</text>

		<text>Terrific Location We stayed at this hotel on our first 4 nights in Australia. The view of Darling Harbour from the room was amazing. The hotel room was excellent in everyway. The location to transport, the harbour, bars, restaurants and ferries couldn't have been better. A lot of business people use this hotel but tourists are made very welcome by the friendly and courteous staff. I would certainly stay here again on my next visit to Sydney.</text>

		<text>Bargain, excellent accomodations Our family of four stayed at the Hotel Porta Faenza in Florence during March 2006. We were pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and the stylish modern furnishings (bathroom as well). Staff was pleasant and very knowledgable about surrounding area and history. Excellent location within walking distance of the train station and hotel parking (reasonable daily rate OF $13.00 US). Best value and accomodations of the six hotels we stayed at in Italy.</text>

There is no hot tub, I thought there was but when I asked about it I was told it had been filled in with concrete. There is also no gift shop.

		<text>Gem in a Non-Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed. I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don't know about this place. We got great service, a great view, a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels (e.g., the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical/health activities). I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them. I can see why -- nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes (mostly) of tourists. I want to stay here again.</text>

		<text>Never stay here! Whew, this place was bad. The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn't let my kids in it, the whole place smelled, and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments. I was literally scared of this place, and when I reported it to the desk, they just said they couldn't stop the calls because they were coming from within the building. Sounds like the beginning of a teen horror movie, doesn't it?</text>

Front desk was great - had to check out very early so when I called for a wake-up call, the operate ordered a cab for me to arrive at a certain time and they packed a breakfast for me (because I'd miss the free breakfast). Room was very comfortable and a good size. Will always stay here in the future!</text>

If you are a jogger, this is an excellent location - run down St. Charles for a few miles in the former trolley tracks or drive a few blocks to Audubon Park and run the loop there. Close to nice restaurants and a large Whole Foods on Magazine Street. A great value too. I will definitely stay here again.</text>

There is a 10 min walk to Central Station, but a tram stops right out side the hotel. We booked through Expedia at around $120/day which I thought was a decent value.

The location is perfect for evening walks by the river, with all the restaurants nearby. The bathroom was the highlight of the accomodations - we had the river view which was spectacular. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone!One downside: the room service breakfast options are limited, you are better off walking to a cafe nearby.</text>

		<text>So comfortable! 15th July, 2006This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite.</text>

		<text>Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii. It was definitely impressive, though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare. Still, it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos. My hotel room had what I'd call a partial ocean view, you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view. I was suprised at how noisy the street below me was, even on the 26th floor, I heard even car horn, every screaming baby, every yelling partier on the street, all night long.</text>

		<text>BE Careful Hotel was OK, had problem with room, lack of water (Hot  Cold) also had small ant infestation. Hotel opened up resources to outsiders on weekends, so you spent your time waiting to be served or dodging children in pools. Also observed staff taking cutlery from one dining table which just finished and placing it on another, not too hygenic, made sure to wash utensils before using. Hotel and staff very pleasant. Hotel was rated when I went as a 4 Star, to me it is 2 Star at best.</text>

When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade (basically all the cars going up can see you). I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later, I got the one I wanted, with a bit of a view for the same price. There's nothing extraordinary about this hotel, the gym is quaint, the rooms are small, the bathroom is actually really big, it was about 1/2 the size of the bedroom... the restaurant is pretty cool.</text>

Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax, a 10% tax that everyone has to pay. Although it's possible for non-Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $300, that doesn't apply to services. You've got a great hotel guys, worth $165 per night of anyone's money, so why not be honest about your prices?</text>

		<text>Good location - dirty bathroom Supposed to be a five star hotel, however this was not exactly what I would call 5 stars. Pros:-great location - convenient for walking places - tianamen, restaurants etc-safe-internet-nice building interiors, food, spa-courteous staff-decent priceCons:-dirty bathroom - moldy, water didn't drain in shower-smelly hallways - my entire hallway smelled of mold and cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a smoke free hallOverall: I'd stay here since this seemed to be a common theme for higher end hotels in China.

		<text>good location, but unorganised Stayed at the hotel Carlton for 1 week in october. The price was reasonable, however we stayed in 3 rooms in that week. We wanted 2 singles, but for 2 nights they were 'unavailable' so we were moved around rooms with double beds. On one occasion there was a couple at reception complaining that they had 2 single beds when they wanted a double, but we were unable to swap with them. Apart from the trouble with the rooms, the location was fantastic, only a quick walk to union square and the staff were polite and helpful.</text>

		<text>Think the HI is getting a bad rap I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of April. My room was spotless (despite what some reviewers have written), and while the bathroom was small, the shower itself was roomy, the hotel bath linens of very good quality and a working iron and ironing board in the closet. The staff was very friendly, very helpful and willing to work with a little Spanglish if communication broke down. I, for one, like not being in a property facing Ashford (it was much quieter) and still less than a block from everything on Ashford. Breakfast every AM in a room facing the pool (which only gets sun in the AM BTW) was good with pastries, juice and coffee. All in all, more than I expected from a Holiday Inn at a reasonable prepurchase rate.</text>

		<text>Fantastic!!!!! Went to this hotel for Valentines weekend, as soon as we arrived we were very impressed as they upgraded us for Free!. The hotel is fantastic and very clean. The staff at the hotel were always very helpful and friendly. This hotel is in a perfect location, and what better way to enjoy it than to go back for a swim and sauna at the end of a busy day. While you are in Paris I would definately recommend going for a meal along the River Seine, and also a meal in the Pavillion Elysee restaurant (along the champse elysee).When I visit Paris again I will stay here again!!!</text>

		<text>decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam, but it wasn't too far from it. It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night. It was clean and comfortable, but nothing spectacular. There were a few burn marks, probably from smokers, but I guess that's to be expected in Amsterdam. The free breakfast was decent, and at least it was free, a rarity in Europe.</text>

		<text>absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews, we were a bit weary about this hotel. It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop. What valuables we did have (passports, cash etc) was stored in the reception safe and always available. Staff were friendly enough, but the main attraction is this hotel's location right on the bustling las ramblas. If it's a quiet place you're after don't book here, but if it's a clean budget hotel right in the heart of things, we would absolutely recommend it.</text>

		<text>Decent deal, decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean, has a modern Asian feel in the decour, and a decent breakfast to start you on your way. The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge. Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring. This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn't seem to know where it was. The surrounding neighbourhood seems a little run-down but perhaps this is just the old feel of the place.</text>

		<text>Just perfect We stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in January, 2006. We arrived a full 39 hours late, due to snow in Tokyo, but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren't there. They even let us stay for an extra night, at the same very low rate. The hotel was great; lots of space, clean, very central to everything in Waikiki, but very quiet too. Will definitely stay there again !</text>

The Hotel was a dream, the staff was friendly and helpful, the location is convenient to everything, and the 5PM wine tasting (Free) was excellent!! We ended up staying 2 nights from our room overlooking the Golden Gate.. I would Highly recommend this Hotel to anyone planning a trip to the S.F. area - my only complaint was the $32.00 a night Valet parking fee (Optional)..</text>

Everything was clean, the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful - from giving us milk at 2am to help us sleep as we were jet lagged to arranging the shuttle bus to take us to Mills avenue so we could go for a night on the town!!Having toured round for two weeks the amenities and service here were not beaten along our travels - high speed internet, breakfast, pool, spa, vending machines, fridge, microwave.

Have no qualms about booking this hotel if you're travelling on a budget (I believe we paid around $50 a night for a double room w/ no WC in high season). However, consider skipping breakfast- for 7 Euro, you could do better at a corner bakery.</text>

		<text>Excellent Hotel and Location This Hotel is in a excellent location close to SF Bay and Trolley Cars with the BART station adjacent to the Hotel. Stayed at this Hotel after a terrible stay as the Westin in Market Street SF,and the differences are huge. This is a modern construction which does NOT shake,rattle and roll when its windy in SF.The Hotel's restaurants are great and breakfast is excellent with wonderful staff especially reception and dining room. Its location allows a wonderful walk to most attractions or catch the Bart. TIP.....catch the BART to SF Airport from the Hotel!!!</text>

		<text>Stay here! This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms (we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious). Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly. I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars. I would have rated it higher and I'm very picky about hotel accomodations. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.</text>

		<text>Large quiet rooms with great service! I stayed for 3 days and was amazed at the size of the room. Having stayed in other NYC hotels, this is by far one of the best for the price. The kitchen was a big money saver and the staff was friendly, knowledgable and helpul. I had to day-sleep needed to change rooms due to construction - they were most gracious. Would definitely stay again.</text>

		<text>Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia. The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted, but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations. Not the best news for our daughters, who were eager to swim after the flight! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door, but whilst better than nothing, this was not terribly convenient. The hotel offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd, but is showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul.</text>

		<text>Just the job Nice little hotel this, right on top of shopping, the Ramblas and a bit of nightlife to boot. Rooftop swimming pool big enough for a cooling dip if you are there when it is warm enough and felt a bit like a scene from a spanish mary poppins looking out over the rooftops from the pool terrace. Rooms well appointed and breakfast adequate. Trying to get a drink from the hotel bar was a challenge but if you are not in a hurry you will get one. Would and probably will return.</text>

		<text>Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A'dam. A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station. We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean, attractive and had an great bathroom. The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little (not mid-forties with beard) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room (free tea/coffee/chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free)Only minor points but will be staying there again in September. Try the DutchFlyer website (Stena lines) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing. Great value and a good alternative to flying.</text>

The location is perfect (a few minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag),the heavenly beds are heavenly, the buffet breakfast is superb and the quality of the hotel far exceeded our expectations. We were there for 3 nights in February and with limited time location is so important - and this hotel was the perfect choice.</text>

		<text>Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English. I asked for an ice machine and was almost sent down the street to a gas station because they thought I was asking for an automatic teller machine. The Cuban music at the restaurant next door started at 10 PM or so and didn't quit until after midnight. Not good if you want to catch an early flight. On the good side they did allow us to check in early and the room was clean.</text>

		<text>ute hotel, but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station, the Accademia and the Duomo, however the noise at night was unbearable! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street, so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel. But if you plan to stay here, make sure you request a room in the back, away from the street (there are many). Otherwise, the reception people were very helpful and my internet-addicted boyfriend loved that there was free internet in the lobby. The room was very clean, nice bathroom, very modern accomodations.</text>

It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough, but no, they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites. Lastly, in an attempt to kill the termites maybe, the hotel has electrical problems that caused a fire, landing their guests in a 鈥渟helter-like鈥?domain, that was surprisingly better compared to the Chateau Dupre.</text>

		<text>Fabulous, and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel. Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city. Having spent a few hours doing the usual sightseeing, we ended up feeling that we should spend more time in the hotel enjoying its facilities (including a lovely swimming pool) and less time pounding the humid streets. It is very expensive but for a short stay, thoroughly worthwhile.</text>

		<text>friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner, given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures, and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were, which we found to be most helpful. The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast (buffet), it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers. A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found, also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby, making the hotel very central but not noisey. We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible. A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam.</text>

The restaurant, Mark's, is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island.

		<text>Great location, not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size. I reserved directly with the hostel by email (in Spanish) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going, specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square. However, we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal, overlooking the road that was being dug up. Although they said the next day we could move rooms, they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning, which was rather annoying. Overall, it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile.</text>

		<text>Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big, new hotel. When you step in to the lobby of the hotel, it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s. Although, the modern amenities in the room and the lobby make the hotel really comfortable. Stay at the Maxwell if you want the small, boutique feel in a hotel.</text>

		<text>great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay, excellent choice, everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great, rooms little small but never in em only to sleep. Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive, find the cava bar by the port side street, cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down. In general spent a fortune its not cheap barcelona but you have to spend when there cause theres loads to do see ya next year  Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed. We knew what to expect in Venice and were happy to be near the train, the vaporetto, piazza di Roma and away from San Marco. The room was nice though not large, the bed and pillows very good and the bathroom excellent. The breakfast was varied and tasty. The decor is understated and the staff was absolutely first class and without attitude.</text>

		<text>I have been staying here for years. My brother and I go to New Orleans two or three time per year. We discovered the Prince Conti Hotel eight years ago, and we have been staying there ever since. The hotel is conveniently located one half block off of Bourbon Street, yet it is very quiet. As always, John, Aimee, Anne, Cindy, Eric, and Lisa take very good care of us. I would recommend the Prince Conti Hotel to anyone looking for a clean, reputable hotel in the French Quarter.</text>

		<text>great locations, fantastic rooms, service could have been better i stayed at the grand hyatt for 5 nights during December 2006. The location was great - right in the heart of union square and close to public transport. The rooms were spacious and clean however the service left a lot to be desired. We arrived at 2pm and were told that our room would not be ready for another 2 hours. would definitely stay there again for the fabulous location.</text>

		<text>Great choice in the Quarter Stayed here for four nights and would choose this hotel again. If your looking for a clean room, near Bourbon Street, friendly staff, at a good price - this is the place. I also was in and out of a few other hotels were relatives were staying, if your looking for four elevators, and a large lobby, and all the stuff that comes with a large big name hotel - you aren't going to get it at the St. Marie. I'd recommend it as a great place to stay for a great price.</text>

		<text>Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it. Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it's a good standard hotel it's no longer that great. Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that. Now seems full of coch parties, meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners. A real shame.</text>

		<text>Location, Location, Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters, this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms (new plasma TV's)at an incredibly good price. Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring. Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones, etc. but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay. We had three rooms for five days (in both of the hotel's two buildings) and everyone was content. Would return in a minute.</text>

		<text>ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance/house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day. The hotel seemed very fake and tried to be hip. The rooms were very comfortable with nice pillows and comfy bed though. Overall, there are many better choices and I cant understand why anyone would want to stay there.</text>

		<text>It'll be great when it's finished! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel. We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed, the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom. Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room. The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there. Highly recommended.</text>

		<text>decent hotel As others have said, this place is nothing special, but for the price and location, it's actually very special. The actual room is a perfectly adequate budget motel room, except that our room had a view of coit tower, transamerica building, and the rest of downtown sf. From what I could see, other more expensive hotels near the area probably can't claim to have the view that we did. And that also means that you can walk to all kinds of great places and take the bus to others. Now if the kind people at the Columbus could only bring some sunshine and warmth to the city, then you would really have something.</text>

		<text>Fantastic Value After reading reviews on the Moore, my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location. We were not disappointed. Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value. Our only knock would be that there was no A/C, which could be a problem on a very hot day as the room gets full afternoon sun.</text>

		<text>Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you're driving a car. The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address; according to the GPS in our rented car, the address did not even exist. It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport (if one doesn't take a shuttle), and consequently we almost missed our plane. We arrived late to check-in at the hotel (just before midnight), yet our room STILL was not ready for us. We certainly do not recommend this hotel.</text>

		<text>Simply Fine, Incredible Value Almost everything was just right. Small hotel, front desk and bell staff unobtrusive and HELPFUL, elevators work well, bed very comfortable room clean and well supplied with basics like 4 glasses changed daily, microwave oven and small 'fridge handy, and supremely knowledgable concierge. Overall, incredible value for NYC.Location - theater district and restaurant row - not bad, although going south on 8th is very down-scale (but feels safe--lots of police blending in everywhere--never got an aggressive vibe from police or civilians). . Firestation around the corner never bothered us with noise, even though room faced the street (on 15th floor may have helped--that height certainly helped make the room bright and airy feeling.)</text>

My wife and I loved the hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was quiet (exactly what we asked for), the atmosphere was great and we both loved the old world charm of the histiric building. Great shopping nearby and an easy walk to most of downtown San Francisco. We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation. This is the second time my wife stayed at the Beresford and it was as a result of her first stay (10 years ago) that we decided to stay there this time, neither of us regretted that decision and we will certainly be staying there the next time we visit San Franciso.</text>

It's reasonably priced, very close to Fisherman's Wharf, has free parking for one car, and the rooms are OK. Stay away from the mini-suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason  Bay; it's one of the noisiest hotel rooms I've ever had the pleasure of being moved from. Great view, though. If you want quiet, you have to put up with the view of the adjacent building.</text>

		<text>Hotel Milano We stayed at the Hotel Milano for two nights prior to our cruise and we had a great time. The employees were very helpful and pleasant. The location was ideal. We would recommend this small but nice hotel if you want to stay in Old San Juan.</text>

		<text>at the monge again Exactly half a year after our first stay in the Hotel Monge we stayed here again for 4 nights. After reading some of the very negative reviews here I was slightly worried if hte positive impression we had had mabye changed. But no; we enjoyed the time there as much as before. The room was extremely clean, enough space for 3 people, the location just always again is simply perfect for buying food, going for walks (Jardin de plantes!) or simply wathcing people. So I still highly recommend this Hotel for people who don麓t want to spend too much money but want to have a nice, clean and friendly stay in a lovely area of Paris!</text>

		<text>Decent...good location Excellent location on Las Ramblas, easy access to transportation. Ask for a recommendation of restaurants to eat at the front desk. Every selection we tried was very good. If you have time to plan in advance, write to the Spanish Embassy for walking tour guide pamphlet. We had 3 days there and followed the pamphlet - great way to see all the sights.</text>

		<text>Wonderful experience I stayed at The Kimberly for only one night on a business trip in April 05. I loved it... The down comforter was amazing!!! They had a great supply of all newspapers available in the lobby for free. I was in a small suite and loved it - tons of space and soo comfortable. I am planning another business trip and while curious about other hotels I am seriously considering The Kimberly again.</text>

		<text>fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor, and yet again have not been let down. This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona, the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel, to when you leave. We had a standard room for four nights, and it was just what we needed, I understand that there are better rooms, but this was above what you normally get in this price range. There was plenty of space, the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy, Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas, but when its cold and wet, we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway. All in all a great hotel, and will be stopping again in the future.</text>

		<text>Great hotel in the middle of nowhere Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed by the hotel, modern, fun and great rooms sizes although it does have a bit of a conference centre feel to it. Had a room on one of the top floors which offered the most spectacular views. The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit. Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area.</text>

		<text>Horrendous customer service Overall, stay was just okay, but was tainted by management's unwillingness to honor their own quoted/written and confirmed total cost. At check-out, ended up paying additional 10% because of hotel's error in confirmation, even after being told at check-in that they would honor confirmed price. For this alone, would never recommend or stay there again, and we do intend to visit San Juan again. Conceptually, hotel was great architectural idea. Interior build-out, however, was done way too frugally, and there was lots of deferred maintainance in room.</text>

		<text>mfortable base for touring New York We stayed at the Eastgate Tower hotel during the October downpours in New York. We found the hotel very comfortable, with a huge suite including a living area, large bed, decent bathroom and usable kitchen. Compared to similar priced hotels in New York, it earns its above average rating. The location is good for the mid-town attractions, and also has good bus and subway links to SoHo, Greenwich Village, etc. Despite the torrential rain, we enjoyed our stay and still managed to have a fantastic time!!</text>

		<text>Supportive Familiy-like Staff My friends and I were some of the many evacuees who waited until the last minute to get out of town before hurricane Katrina. During such a scarey time, the hotel staff became like family in that they did EVERYTHING in their power to make our stay there as comfortable as possible....not easy with the limited resources that were available after the storm hit. Our safety was their highest priority, however they did their best to keep everyone as comfortable as possible during those very unforgetable days. I do plan to stay at the Hotel Le Cirque again...if only just to thank the staff for being there for us.</text>

We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris, so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury. The location on the Ramblas was ideal (right near the metro stop from the train station too) and the room was just wonderful. We highly reccomended this hotel to anyone.</text>

		<text>Pure Quality, if you don't mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week. Had a great room overlooking the church (17th floor). I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal, service was good and the bar area was impressive. This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside, but you do pay for it - (my room rate was of around $600 a night).Overall very happy with the hotel, though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $27.</text>

		<text>Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights' stay at the NY Palace, I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC. My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality, the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick Cathedral on top of those, the use of the lounge was a great boon for us, supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant, friendly and civilized surroundings, the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not-so-friendly city as New York. Also, unlike what was written in a previous preview, we were there with our five yrs old child (having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level) and he was always made to feel at home (I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there). I will definitely return to the Palace.</text>

		<text>Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter, picking the location for it's convenience for the airport for a flight the next day. Rooms are small and functional, bathroom 'unit' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed. Bedding was a little strange, with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers. Staff were efficient, breakfast in the morning was good and transfer to airport was on time (despite being chargeable which is not what was advertised). It's a decent enough place, even if you still get some noise from aircraft due it's proximity to the runway.</text>

		<text>Immaculate, vintage hotel with personable staff--worth the price This impeccably-restored, 1880's era hotel is clean and quiet and wonderfully located in a popular historic district near the waterfront. Our train was delayed and the night desk clerk cheerfully greeted us at 3 AM and even held the door for us. The breakfast, including hard-boiled eggs, various cereals and fresh batter with waffle-maker, was delicious. It is a bit pricey but we would stay there again in a heartbeat and recommend it highly.</text>

		<text>Location, Location, Location -- and a great hotel Just returned from staying three nights at the Chancellor Hotel and have to say that all the Trip Advisor reviews were right on the money. We enjoyed the above-par service, the clean and cozy room (yes, a little tight but workable), the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24/7, and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere -- all at a very reasonable price. Best of all, the hotel is totally non smoking!! Location is perfect, right near Union Square and in front of a cable car stop, within walking distance of many fine resturaunts and shopping areas. Kudos to the Chancellor for making our stay in San Francisco most enjoyable!</text>

		<text>Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used (think they may have gone out of business now as can't find them any more) to the Hotel Piet Hein. When we arrived thought nice hotel, only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel's annex which was a few doors down the same street. Absolute nightmare of a room, up three flights of very steep stairs, room very dirty, ripped curtains, mould in bathroom, stained carpets, etc. Didn't get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in. In short, not somewhere I would reccomend. That said, things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago, but beware when booking, make sure its the main hotel which is really nice.</text>

It seemed we arrvived in Spain or Turkey. Really this hotel is not worth a 5 star rating. After one night staying we packed our bags and left the hotel.</text>

		<text>Excellent Location I stayed at this hotel for pleasure using Marriott Reward points for 2 nights. The hotel is ideally situated in the Circular Quay area, only 3 minutes from the City Train stop from the airport. Circular Quay is also where the Opera House and the Ferries are located allowing easy access to all of Syndney, including the Rocks area, Harbor Bridge, shopping, Rocks market, and ferries to Manly and everywhere else. The hotel was also within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants in the Rocks area. The room provided was better than average for Marriott, with all amenities and nice shower.</text>

		<text>great little hotel My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights art start of july and it was perfect for what we wanted - a real find. Located in quiet area but a quick 15-20 mins walk to San Marco square. Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was lovely (far surpassed expectations, Fruit, croissants, cheese, meat and lovely coffee made fresh from espresso maker) served in the little courtyard. While it has a 2 star rating, its because it doesn't have things like elevators, a big fancy lobby or iron for guests, but everything else about it was 4 star!</text>

They quickly sent a repairman. Ten minutes later, nice warm air and no more problems. No hotel is perfect, so high marks for quick fixes at the Sofitel, D.C.</text>

		<text>Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge -but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .</text>

		<text>Divine! This hotel, with its immaculately clean and well-fitted rooms, situated at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, is the perfect base for any holiday in this extraordinarily beautiful, safe and secure city. The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful, the service is splendid, however what really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the Breakfast Room on the 6th Floor with its stunning views of the Duomo, the Campanile and a myriad of terra-cotta rooftops. What an environment to enjoy a truly sumptuous buffet breakfast that really sets you up for the day!</text>

		<text>Fantastic trip We stayed for four nights at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in June 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic. The one bedroom suite is fabulous and great for the money. Its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite which is great. The staff were always helpful, plus on the day we were leaving they let us have our room for half a day extra at no charge. We enjoyed our stay at and will go there again 100% for sure!</text>

		<text>A happy accident We were put into this hotel by BA when our aircraft developed a mechanical problem and the return flight to London had to be delayed until the next day. In every way the Sheraton Gateway was better than the Holiday Inn at LAX where we spent the first night of our recent holiday. The lobby staff were efficient, the food and service in the restaurant were good and our room was great. We will definitely consider returning to this hotel when we stay at LAX again.</text>

		<text>Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms, so we decided to try this (based on reviews from TripAdvisor, of course).Upon arriving at the airport (Narita), we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there, right across the street from the hotel. Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo, but that's a 5 minute train ride, with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3~5.About the hotel it is huge, with many options for food and entertainment, I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses. Depending on which tower you stay in (Main Tower was great), the rooms are new, but a bit small, with everything needed in a hotel, including a small fridge (bring your snacks and water).Very clean, nothing to say about that, except that some floors smelled like cigarretts. Internet is paid (about US$10.00) and it is wired, so bring your wireless router (Apple makes a great pocket-sized one).There's a convenience store downstairs, that over charges everything, but when needed it's there.</text>

		<text>Don't believe anything you read or half of what your hear We recently came back from this resort. It is advertised on the Sol Melia website as being fully renovated, which it hasn't been touched in eight years and is in need of a complete overhaul. The food is mediocure at best, 11 restaurants, only three or four open each night, beach chairs moldy and streached out, dirty beach, mildewed rooms, worn fabrics and furniture in rooms, mini bar not stocked or cold, disagreeable staff, bad service and bugs in the rooms. AA Vacations website states this is a five star property. We would rate it -5 stars. Royal Service is a joke, don't dare pay extra for it, you will be sorry, extra money for nothing, and don't drink the water.</text>

		<text>Not bad but could be better, even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations -- really quite nice, but the room itself was fairly spartan. It did have a little sitting area, with two chairs and a table, but the beds were rock hard (you want to ease down on them gently, lest you break a body part). The air conditioning was non-operative during our very warm stay in early-mid May (the screenless window opened, however), the TV remote control did not work, although there was an attempt to repair it, and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced -- and was, with one that smelled somewhat less musty. On the positive side, the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful, the public areas and the rooms were immaculate, the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient, if not particularly appealing. 聽聽</text>

We splurged a little on a superior double room, and had a good-sized room with a balcony overlooking the plaza in front. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room itself was clean and perfectly fine. And, the location is pretty hard to beat - just a block from the Plaza Mayor, close to the bars and restaurants, not far from a Metro stop. I would definitely stay there again.</text>

If you're paying for yourself (as opposed to business expenses), it's probably not worth the money. Only point where the Hilton Barcelona is above average is the decor, which looks modern and a little more characterful than the average 1970's brown and bronze, chandeliers and marble that most Hiltons seem to display.</text>

		<text>Three cheers for the Ramada I have travelled to Amsterdam many times but this is the best value for money hotel in it's class bar none. My room was imaculate with a comfy bed and was well designed with a cool bathroom and deep bath. The location cannot really be improved upon as it is a mere 5 min. walk to central station and even backs onto a little known red light area for some late night action. The only downsides are the lack of air-con and a fridge, but hey you do get a fan and a fridge is not essential really. All for about 拢40 per night, I have paid considerably more for a lot less, get it booked.</text>

A good location in Tokyo, the Metro is really close (use the covered underground walkway most of the way that means you don't have to cross any roads to get there) and provides good access to both East and West of the city and Akasaka has a good mix of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

		<text>Our Home in Florence This hotel feels much more like a home than an institution--for us, that feeling came from the moment we met Carmel, who grew up in Boston, and she invited us upstairs onto her lovely outside terrace. Located near enough to the train station to be convenient for travel but on a side street, Hotel Il Bargellino is also near to several Florentine sights. Our only complaint was that the noice from the street can be a little annoying late at night, but it's a trade-off for being right in close proximity to so much. Carmel enticed us as customers by helping us find the best accomodations in her hotel, and we will stay here again upon our next trip to Florence.</text>

		<text>Great location and spacious room We stay for 2 nights at the hotel. It is not new, but has an excellent location. It is steps of Ginza, metro station, restaurants, etc... The concierges were excellent and give us good suggestions and very detail information to go where we want. Also the recommendation of restaurants out of the hotel works fine.</text>

		<text>Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic For our first trip to Venice, and a special anniversary and birthday holiday, I cannot imagine any place could have been better. The staff was incredible, booking perfect reservations for dinners and helping us with transportation. I arranged in advance to have flowers in the room for my wife, and everything was done to perfection. This is one of the finest hotels I have ever enjoyed, and I highly recommend it. The location is perfect as well.</text>

		<text>Nice place, bad food If you like bland food, cheap beer and rude Europeans - this is the place for you.11 of us just returned from a week in DR. The hotel was beautiful, but all of us were disappointed in the food and the drink selection. This is the first Caribbean resort I've stayed at that didn't have blenders behind the bar. Going back to Cozumel next time.</text>

		<text>Loved the Marriott Marquis New York Stayed at this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor. The hotel was fantastic we were made to feel special, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We had a Time Square view at no extra cost, the room was huge with sofa's and chairs, the bed was huge clean linen every day. We had concerns about the lifts after reading some of the reviews but I don't think we ever had to wait more than a minute for a lift. The hotel was a joy and will definately will be staying there again.</text>

Most of all though, the beds were like sleeping on a cloud. They were extremely comfortable so much so that I almost over slept and missed my seminar. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel.</text>

The location is ok - close to Sentosa access but a little further from other attractions such as Chinatown and City Centre - but these are very easily reached by the MRT. If you are planning a holiday where you stay in your room - spring for a place with bigger rooms. Great place to spend the night if only have a quick stop over and money is important!</text>

		<text>Wouldn't atay anywhere else in Manahattan Over the past ten years, we have stayed at Hotel Beacon four times and - having stayed at some other hotels - we would never stay anywhere else in NYC,The rooms are huge and very comfortable with a small but well-equipped kitchenette. It's a great location, stunning views to Central Park or the Hudson from the upper floors - don't forget to ask when booking because they do try to give you what you request; buses and subway within moments of the door - or just walk to Columbus, Amsterdam, Central Park, even Mid -Town. One particularly brilliant aspect of Hotel Beacon: Fairways foodstore directly across Broadway from the Beacon. a jaw-dropping selection of stuff to eat, including a hot food counter which makes eating in any restaurant a bit of a waste of time: grab a bottle of wine at the Beacon Liquor store, Korean chicken or something at Fairways then dine at your Hotel Beacon room window overlooking a million Manhattan lights. Unforgetable. Frankly at these prices there is no point in staying anywhere else, particularly if you fancy experiencing the rather attractive life of an Upper Westside New Yorker!</text>

		<text>Luxury-like experience at an affordable price Boutique-like service at a name brand chain. The Westin times square was a great lodging experience for me. Check-in was a breeze, and I was happy to find that they upgraded my room for me based on a first time comment that I left on my reservation. Hotel is very clean and at a fantastic location. I honestly don't know what else I could recommend in Manhattan unless you are looking for more of a party scene (gansevoort) or even more luxury (lowes regency, morgans group, etc). Honestly, for price to experience ratio, the Weston gets a 10/10 in my book.</text>

		<text>Safer than expected Having read some reviews of this hotel we, as pensioners, were rather apprehensive about tales of dodgy characters and threatening transients in the vicinity of the hotel. However we have just returned from 6 days at the Della Natione and at no time did we feel unsafe or threatened, we also found the Duomo to be a 7 minute walk away not 15 and we are in our 60's. The hotel was comfortable, we had a quiet room which was cleaned regularly together with the bathroom and although the breakfast was continental it was more than adequate with supplies of foods being constantly replenished. The staff were friendly and helpful and pre-booked tickets for us when required.</text>

		<text>Great Breakfast Stayed at the Catalonia Aragon for 3 nights last month (November 2005). Clean, stylish rooms. Front Desk was extremely helpful with our lost luggage problem. Not in center of town, but nearby metro and train to airport. And as others have stated- a great breakfast!</text>

		<text>Great little place Good quality and value hotel. Rooms are clean and attractive for the price, and the bathrooms are very good. Breakfast buffet is value for money and good too! As it's near to the train station the area is just 'average' but it's a close walk to all the things you want to see so it's really not a problem. Overall, very good and would stay there again.</text>

		<text>Good value, great location Stayed at the Monticello over Memorial Day weekend 2004. Was genuinely surprised and pleased that the room we reserved turned out to be a suite. I wasn't expecting that. Staff was very friendly and helpful, from replacing our mini-bar when the key broke off in it (!), to addressing a plumbing issue with a tempermental toliet, to securing our bags after checking out while we toured the city on our last day in town, to arranging for our shuttle ride to the airport. Also very convienent to the cable car terminus and other public transportation. All-in-all, a good experience.</text>

		<text>loved this place My girlfriends i stayed here for a week, We had the best time ever. Everyone there was very courtious with an exception of the unhappy young front desk girl but Orlando down on the beach made up for that. Our room was good sized and our room looked out to the beach. The only downfall to this getaway was when it was time to take a Taxi back to the airport. I highly recommend this place to others and highly anticipate my oppurtunity to go again in December.</text>

		<text>uldn't wait to leave I've usually found the Marriotts to be fairly good, but this one was disappointing and just a notch above a Travel Inn. Location was ok, but not central, as it was a good 15-minute walk to Dam Square and the Centraal Station. The hotel had absolutely no character whatsoever; the lobby was uninviting; and the food in both the breakfast and the bar restaurants was only just ok. The room was a good size, and the furnishings looked relatively new and comfortable, but there was a strong drainage smell in the bathroom all the time, and there was a fizzing electrical sound all through the night, which only went away when it was drowned out by the loud air con. When I mentioned this to the reception staff at check-out, they weren't interested and didn't even comment. Only go if you get a very cheap rate as you can get this sort of mediocrity anywhere.</text>

		<text>Wonderful Place to stay in Madrid We booked this hotel due to its central location and Trip Advisor ratings and weren't disappointed. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were excellent and we ate a nice dinner one night in their restaurant when we were too tired to go back out. The bathroom was huge and the price was reasonable--nice contrasts with Barcelona. The room itself was adequate. There are lots of great restaurants and tapas bars in Madrid but be sure to try La Casa del Abuelo (Near Puerto del Sol) for shrimp with garlic.</text>

		<text>There are Better Options than this tired, outdated hotel I give it two circles instead of 1, only because of its location next to the Hynes convention center and Prudential Center. We paid $250 per night (convention rate) for a cramped room with low ceilings, outdated furnishings, and paint peeling from the ceiling. The hotel is not friendly to families with young children, and charges extra for items included in lower priced chains, e.g. extra fee to use the fitness center and pool, along with internet. If you want a nice room in the Back Bay, try the Lenox.</text>

		<text>Gem of a hotel This is a particularly agreeable hotel with friendly staff, nice furnishings, and excellent value for money given the included breakfast, wine/cheese evenings, and coffee and tea on-tap, so to speak. Our petite double room was, as expected, space-challenged, but clever use of the available space minimized the bother, and for a 2-night stay it was not a problem. For longer stays, I would invest in a larger room. Particularly appreciated was the ability to set up my laptop and connect to the internet for free without having to re-arrange the furniture, unplug lamps, and so on (which is so often the case at more expensive hotels).The lounge on the 2nd floor is a lovely space to relax, and the bar on the top floor is also worth a visit (or two).</text>

Thank goodness because when I saw it as I drove by on the highway, it looked pretty terrible. I should have been better about writing down all of the cancellation info, because a month later, they charged me for the room I didn't even stay in, and refuse to refund my money. Don't stay there - save yourself a headache. There are plenty of other affordable places to stay in San Juan without having to experience the unprofessionalism of this awful place.</text>

		<text>Excellent Hotel, very helpful staff We booked this hotel on Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights before our cruise. The hotel has one of the best overal in Barcelona, within a few yards to the underground, five minutes walk to Las Ramblas and five minutes walk to the beautiful modern port area where there are endless walks and pleasure boat trips available. We were going on a cruise and needed a taxi to get to the cruise port (12 - 20 euro, depending on the driver).The trip in from the airport cost just over 30 Euros and takes about 20 minutes depending on traffic although evening rush hours can take over an hour easily. The hotel staff were excellent and they offer free WiFi access or broadband using their own business centre if you do not carry your own laptop. The breakfast buffet in the hotel is a bit limited but if you purchase breakfasts for the full duration of your stay it will only cost 9.50 Euro and is very reasonable as the food is of good quality although the hot items are a bit limited. Or if you prefer there are plenty of restaurants and bakeries within a few minutes walk.</text>

		<text>great value for money, good area Me and 4 friends stayed in this motel for a few nights in October and were very pleased with the value for money. The motel is indeed on Lombard Street, which is in fact a section of the 101, but as we had rooms away from the street we didn't have any trouble with the noise. The rooms themselves were pretty much the same as any motel room we saw during our round trip, nothing exceptional but very adequate. The biggest plus is the area, it's in a nice little neighbourhood with shops and some excellent dining right around the corner! We particularly enjoyed 'Barneys' with its 'gourmet burgers'. It's not downtown, but a short busride has you in the heart of Chinatown in no time.</text>

Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away</text>

Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled.

		<text>Wonderful Hotel!! Just returned from a five night stay at the Beacon, and couldn't have been happier. Perfect location, quiet nights, and the convenience of the market across the street made our vacation great. Subway is a short walk down the street, Natural History Museum a couple blocks away, as well as Central Park. The front desk and concierge were especially helpful, and very friendly. Highly recommend this hotel!!</text>

We were originally booked in to stay at the Strozzi Palace Hotel, but the bathrooms there had flooded, so they kindly transferred us to the Pierre for the same price. If you're looking for a hotel in a really good central location, with a luxurious feel to it and friendly service, I would say this is the one if you can afford their prices.</text>

		<text>Good-sized clean rooms but service could be improved We booked a standard room at the Villa Mazarin. We found it centrally located (we walked to most of the major tourist sites) and the rooms were decent sized and comfortable. What let it down somewhat for us was the service at the front desk - they were by no means rude, but made you feel like you were bothering them if you asked them any questions. If the service were more personable and efficient, then we would have had no complaints about the Mazarin.</text>

		<text>On the whole....fab I have to say that most of the reviews are spot on. IT IS a lovely little hotel, great value, great location, nice staff, and I would without a doubt stay there again. They are a couple of things that others have mentioned which are also true, thin walls (felt like someone else was in the room) and it was a bit of a tight squeeze around the bed, but that was it. I had friends staying in one of the suites and that was great, so if you want a bit more of a treat for an extra 30 euros book one of those.</text>

		<text>Rust, mold and cold water While the refurbished lobby, restaurants and bars are still elegant and luxurious, the standard rooms are far more reminiscent of a decrepit dorm room. Chipped paint, rusting fixtures, moldy grout and an utter lack of amenities. The assorted selections of soaps and shampoos, apparently borrowed from other hotels, is not critical, but is indicative of the curent state of the Biltmore. Waking up to find a mixture of cold to luke warm water dribbling out of the five foot high showerhead only reinforced an already negative impression. The staff are certainly accomodating and room service was adequate, but I would wait until a complete renovation of the rooms before ever staying at the Biltmore again.</text>

As far as accommodation and service were concerned, it's one of my best hotel experiences. The only downsides to our stay were (1) the dinner in the hotel's haute cuisine restaurant, Petrus, which was good, but not good enough for the prices charged (our best meals in HK were in Nobu and in M at the Fringe); and (2) the afternoon tea in the lounge in the Shangri La, which didn't live up to the standards of a five star hotel.</text>

We travelled with a baby and though a very clean and comfortable cot was waiting for him in our room, the lack of space and facilities like a kettle made things a bit difficult.

		<text>Decent package deal Hotel room was decent for the price paid for. It did show some age in the walls and furniture but serves the purpose for a place to stay. Small kichenette was useful for the fridge and microwave. Should always prefer a double over a single king size bed since the room is so much more! Conveniently across from the international market and walking distance to the beach. Also has complimentary trolley to the mall.</text>

		<text>Great hotel We stayed at the Hotel Regina in May 2007 for 4 nights and the hotel was just perfect. It was very modern, clean and very relaxing. The rooms were fantastic and the breakfast was the best selection I have seen. The location was also ideal. Overall a fantastic stay in the hotel Regina.</text>

		<text>Good choice We stayed in this hotel when we travelled to Frankfurt to watch the World Cup. The hotel is in a good, central location. It is close to the main shopping district and about 10-15 minutes walk away from the main square and the main restaurants area. There are plenty of nice little restaurants right next to the hotel though. This is very much a business hotel with a clean, sophisticated reception area, very professional staff and good sized modern rooms and bathrooms. We booked well in advance on the hotel's website and were able to get the room for a very cheap rate - especially considering this is a four star hotel and the City was hosting the World Cup!</text>

		<text>Entertainment team I visited Excellence Punta Cana DR, and I must comment on how great this resort is. The accomadations, amedities, food and most of all the entertainment, made this resort a return vacation in the future. I enjoyed all of the activities such as dancing, spanish lessons, aqua arobics, volleyball, and so much more. I don't think any of these activities would be possible with out the excellent entertainment staff, who went out of their way to say hello, include you in the activities, and just plain make it fun. It was was like the real life version of Dirty Dancing- minus the drama. Thank you Mariel, Eliza and Jaun Carlo, just to name a few.</text>

		<text>smelly rooms, no hot choc but cool view! good value but a bit crap if you consider the smelly smokey rooms and the suspicious showers. The view from the room window is lovely though, over the Amstel, very romantic sunsets and sunrise... for breakfast, there's either coffee or tea only, personnally i need some creamy hot chocolate to start the day but there were none available, only as an extra, so i had to pay 5 euros extra on the 7euros all-inclusive buffet breakfast!!!Watch out for the boozy brittish slags around the bar/lounge, they can be messy with their beer..!</text>

		<text>Highly recommended I don't understand how this hotel could get any bad reviews. My girlfriend and I stayed here from March 22-25, 2005 and found everything more than satisfactory. It has a great location, great price, friendly service, and a good breakfast. We didn't have any problems with making reservations or having clean rooms as was reported by other reviewers. The only complaint I can think of... it was my understanding that parking was included, but we had to pay $7 a night instead. This was still cheaper than any public parking in the area or compared to other hotels in the area.</text>

The hotel saff was very nice and they had a decent breakfast in a beautiful room. We found the location to be great, but would not stay in this hotel again due to the cleanless. The hotel is over 500 years old and it seemed like they have not changed the bed linenes and matresses for over 200 years. Everything seemed dirty.</text>

		<text>Give It A Miss The hotel is in a great location, but I would have serious doubts in recommending the hotel as there are several deficiencies that need immediate attention. Hotel is in need of some seious maintenance i.e. broken counter tops, leaking taps, no self closing room doors, window locks not working and musty stench from stairwells. There is no parking at the hotel and runs $18 - $25 per day plus tax. No High Speed Internet access at all is available, you have to cross the road to a sister property's lobby and pay $10 a day. Had a bad experience with a rude staff member while checking out, but that hasn't swayed my review.</text>

		<text>Not the best Hotel is in a great location - short walk to Darling Harbour, shops, restaurants etc. Building and rooms are extremely tired thought and the whole place needs a make-over. The carpets are stained and the interior is very poorly maintained. The buffet lunch was nice, but room service meal was apalling and once done tray and leftovers sat in the hallway for almost a full-day. There are many better choices in Sydney - probably less expensive too.</text>

		<text>Good location, but get an inside room The Moore is an old place in a good section of downtown, between Seattle Center  Pike Place Market. Our first room was on the street  was a bit noisy (there's no A/C, so we had the windows open). We switched the next night to a courtyard room, but you still get some reflected traffic noise. The courtyard rooms surround the Moore Theater, so you might not want to stay there on a concert night (unless you don't go to bed early). I'd still prefer this over the budget hotels near Seattle Center.</text>

		<text>Loved the hotel, staff and location The airport bus (1 stop from the airport) dropped us close to the hotel (400m) from Placa d Espanya, situated on a very quiet back street but close to two metro stations (the best way to get around).Upon arrival we had to get the paperwork out to check that there had not been a mistake on the price as it far exceeded our expectations. We used a three day metro ticket to travel around, it was so easy, and the hotel gave us advice and a map. We were very close to the Magic Fountains, the tourist bus stops and Crue Coberta shopping street. The only negative was the lack of places to eat and drink but we did find an Asian restaurant with no English spoken and had a great buffet meal, better that we had in the port at a fraction of the price as it was where the locals ate, 50m from the hotel. The room was great with a large bed, a decent bathroom and a cheap mini-bar.</text>

Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen's on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience. Although hotel and roof top is a very nice amenity defintely stay away from their restaurant and their very arrogant mangager Alex.</text>

		<text>Great hotel A great hotel in a fantastic location right next to Checkpoint Charlie. I received a free room upgrade to a maisonette on the 5th floor with a balcony overlooking the street - very nice!Excellent, varied breakfast, extremely pleasant staff and good overall level of service. One criticism - I was visiting Berlin with work and so needed internet access in my room. Unfortunately the wireless signal was very weak and I kept loosing the connection. Other than that I have nothing but praise for this very comfortable hotel!</text>

		<text>Farjardo Inn, San Juan PR - Worth the Money Farjardo Inn - San Juan PR - Worth the moneyOctober 24, 2006TripAdvisor Member, Waco TXThe inn and grounds were prettty and well kept. The room was not fancy, but was large and very clean and comfortable. This hotel is not on the beach but a beautiful beach is very near by. The only problems we encountered were very few signs directing us to the hotel and when we called the first time, the desk clerk was unable to give us directions from the town plaza which was less than 1 mile away. There are a lot of steps and steep inclines on the property, but overall it was well worth the money.</text>

		<text>Beautiful, relaxing, great service. Loved the hotel...flew into Barcelona with my 5 year old daughter and stayed here our first 3 nights. After renting a car and heading out on a road trip of northern spain decided to book our last night here as well. My daughter was thrilled to be able to use the pool at the neighboring hotel - that she could see from our window. That hotel was much busier and we were thankful that although our hotel was geared more towards business folks that we felt very comfortable. Internet service is available on the bottom floor.</text>

		<text>Great locale and Service, a bit tattered Stayed here two nights in april visiting family etc. What the hotel may lack in modern it makes up for in fabulous staff, free sodas and chips, wonderful continental breakfast with home made baked goods, and spacious rooms. Speaking of the rooms - they are very dated - the furniture in living room was coming apart, the drawers in the dresser of our bedroom had no tracks and the sink in bathroom was mildewed. It's in need of an uplift but met our needs and the weather around poolside was fabulous.</text>

		<text>Do Not Stay Here!!!!! We rented 2 rooms through Orbitz at $231 and $271 per night, and it was absolutely the worst value for the money I have ever experienced. The rooms were the smallest I have ever seen with sealed windows, loud air conditioning, amenities (loosely used) from the 1950s and room keys that did not work. We fortunately stayed only 1 night and moved to a much nicer location for the rest or our week. I would not advise my worst enemy to stay here.</text>

Even though I had to share a bathroom, it was very clean and always available because it was shared only between me and a person staying at the next single room. The hotel staff were very helpful and charming. Location was good too. It was close enough to walk from tube, bus stops and Victoria station. I do recommend this hotel to everyone.</text>

		<text>Hotel Nadia Hotel Nadia is lovely - the staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean (as a family, we had the 'quad' which was a bit of a squeeze but the beds were very comfortable and plenty of cupboard space). The steep stairs might put some people off. The dining room is also small and tables were not always available for breakfast. Also the central location meant that traffic noise (and church chimes!) were noticeable. But walking distance of many places and right near Ann Frank Museum. Would stay there again.</text>

The bed was extremely comfortable, breakfast was fantastic (including champagne for mimosas), the shower was terrible (not clear on why hotels don't have showers that have doors that actually close and keep the water in). The concierge was great (when it wa the actual concierge, and not a temporary fill in) and the front desk staff was fantastic. Terrific location about 1/2 mile from the Uffizi Gallery and right around the corner from a Piazza with shops and restaurants.</text>

Its location was fantastic, close to all the attractions, and transport via the Metro is literally 30sec away.

		<text>Great place to stay! My husband and I had been to New Orleans on two previous occasions-for the French Quarter Festival and for Mardi Gras just prior to Katrina. Even with remodeling going on, our stay at the Bienville House was wonderful! Our room was large, decorated with period furnishings/antiques and the bed was the most comfortable we have had at any hotel. The hotel was just as the pictures on the websites showed, the staff was friendly and helpful and even though the Heritage Cafe and Gamay Bistro were not open as the websites said, we had a wonderful stay at the Bienville House. We have already recommended to our friends who will be going to the Jazz Fest to check out the Bienville House for a great time.</text>

		<text>Hated the Water Club While size(small) and location (directly at beach near old San Juan) suited us well, the overall experience was terrible. While many very cool design features were distinctive the negatives far outweighed these, i.e. very small room, very loud street noises and blaring music from rooftop bar until wee hours of a.m., beat up old furniture and inferior sushi and tiny pool and pretentious eating area at pool that requires you buy a bottle of liquor in order to use large sofa like banquette seating. In all fairness, beds did provide lovely ocean view and staff were sincere and very helpful. Not enough reason to ever go back.</text>

The hotel was easy to find, and our room turned out to be quite nice. Air conditioning worked as advertised and cooled the room well at all hours. Furnishings were quite functional, and we got to see our first bidet in this first stop in Italy.

		<text>Most Disappointed Having seen all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the previous couple of months, we booked The Chancellor for four nights at the beginning of September. Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations, and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising. We were incredulous that when we arrived, the doorman stood and watched whilst we carried our luggage in without even opening the door for us. This attitude, combined with unfriendly staff on the front desk and a very tired and shabby looking bedroom, led to a disappointing stay at The Chancellor. We would not recommend staying at this hotel.</text>

		<text>Location, Location, Location We enjoyed a 3 day stay at the Parc 55! The location is the best because of the proximity to BART (across the street), and the cable cars (1 block away). Westfield Shopping Center is located directly across the street (Nordstroms, Bloomingdale, great food court too).The service and the rooms were excellent and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco that would like to be close to the shopping and public transportation. It is right on Market Street, and is close to Chinatown. Parking is a little pricey at $40 for overnight; however, parking is at a premium at this location. We found great rates for this hotel on Expedia; however, I would recommend that you check out their website (Parc 55) first because they have several special package rates.</text>

		<text>Nice Airport Hotel Very nice overnight stay at the Steigenberger. I was in the Executive Tower, with a very nice room, comfortable bed and great shower. Breakfast was about average for a hotel like this. The free shuttle to Frankfurt Airport runs 24 hrs a day and takes less than 10 minutes, making it easy to get on the S-Bahn to go to either downtown Mainz or Frankfurt or a variety of other locations. This is definitly a good value for an airport hotel. It's not as convienient as a hotel that is actually in the airport, but the location off site makes it nice and quiet - the rooms are extremely well insulated.</text>

My room had two huge flat screen TVs and a view of Reforma but beyond that the furniture was nothing special for a hotel of this caliber. Also, while I expect to pay more for room service, internet access, and hotel cars in a more expense hotel like the Four Seasons, the prices seemed a bit excessive: $50 for a room service dinner of one beer, one bowl of soup, and a sandwich and $25 for wireless internet access.</text>

No elevator queues, friendly competent staff in all areas, gorgeous condo, great location and views, masonry construction (so no noise transference between condos) - no street noise with doors closed.

		<text>Elegant bargain Lovely hotel, clean and new due to recent remodelling, which seems to be completed. (As of 12/07 there is some construction on the east side of the hotel, but it does not affect hotel access.) Breathtaking views of Hudson River and WTC site. Close to Tribeca, subway, and steps from train station at WTC.You can get great deals directly from their website, probably to build up business again after remodel. Highly recommended.</text>

		<text>Loved the Location I was warned that it was away from the city centre. My check in was handled reasonably smooth and the room was a decent size. The staff were very courteous. There is a market place on the other side but this does not cause any disturbance. The tram stop is just across the road and most of the sites are accessible quickly. A tram card is an important asset in Amsterdam.</text>

		<text>Noisy... I must admit the Hotel Fusion is a great bargain in a great location. My room was large but basic. My only compaint is that while they went to great lengths to renovate the hotel they overlooked one detail, insulated windows. I was on the 4th floor and the street noise penetrating into my room overnight was almost unbearable. I am not a light sleeper and if you are I would recommend staying somewhere else.</text>

		<text>Fantastic Palace Just back from a long weekend over Paddy's day and this hotel is up there with some of the finest i have ever stayed in. The staff were all more than happy to help and always met us with a smile. The hotel is fantastically placed 1 block from 5th Avenue and about 5 mins from Central Park. Food was excellent, however, we preferred to eat out just to make the most of the trip. Great hotel but look around the web and see if you cant get it any cheaper than you find at firs</text>

		<text>lean but Noisy Reasonably clean, great location by attractions but horrifically noisy, both from street traffic and denizens of the hotel itself. Staff was very nice. Room cleaning products very smelly, so be careful if you are sensitive. Parking an issue - not enough spots by the end of the day. Bottom line: because it was so much less expensive than any other property in the area (approximately $100/night less) we would likely stay here again if we couldn't find a better deal elsewhere.</text>

		<text>Loved Alam Kulkul We stayed our last night in Bali at Alam Kulkul, as soon as we entered the room, we liked it, even though our room was on the very last corner , but the atmosphere inside was homey, it was not modernly designed or looked new, but very comfortable. I think it was because the room was bright. We also tried their Jamu Spa treatment : Hot Stone massage and Warm tea leaves Facial which was divine. We definitely will come back to Alam Kulkul in our next trip to Bali, and that time we would like to try their villa, which we're sure that is well groomed too, just like their hotel room. We highly recommend alam kulkul to everyone.</text>

		<text>Good choice for central location Clean with nice decor and reasonably large rooms. Excellent location about 10- minutes walk from Barri Gothic and 15minutes from the SAngria Familia. The hotel is great as a base base to visit the sites or even if you are there on business ( free internet connection) . However there are few facilities outside the room and the food (breakfast only) is very limitted in range and quality- for 6 euros you would be much better visitting on of the many local cafes.</text>

The hotel was warm, clean, safe and very British. Breakfast was a huge cold buffet as well as hot offerings from the kitchen; a real treat. Though not the least expensive room in the city, for about $200, it was, for two of us, worth every penny. Plus we got to leave our bags there the next day while we were out exploring.</text>

Polite staff, peaceful surroundings, cool settings, pool deck on the top floor to cool off in the hot afternoons. I have to say that this hotel made our stay near perfect.

		<text>Great City Centre Hotel Having just had a 3 night stay at the Park Plaza I can't understand why it gets such bad reviews. It is a typical city centre hotel and everyone should bear in mind that it is 80 years old and so doesn't have the modern look of some of the newer hotels in Boston. The staff were always happy to help, the room we had was large, very clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a great location for seeing all Boston has to offer. I would most definitely book here again.</text>

		<text>xcellent stay Book this hotel back in August for a November stay,someone at the marriott hotel website made a mistake and had the web price for a two bedroom lakeview suite at $29.00 instead of $229. I jumped on it and booked it and thought I might get a hassle over it but instead the front desk staff were impressed at the rate I had recieved and happily checked me in. The staff were very friendly and the shuttle driver was excellent taking us to the downtown area whenever we needed him,of course a tip seemed to help with that. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable with a extended buffet breakfast. I would stay here again when in the area.</text>

		<text>Green credentials This is a new hotel that claims a range of green features, some of which seemed to be stretching the point somewhat. However it was a pleasant stay with particularly firendly and helpful staff. Minus points were the size of the bedroom (small); a sliding door on the bathroom that didn't have any pretence at privacy; high bar prices ($14 for a glass of wine) and exorbitant parking charges ($37 per day) when there were public facilities on the same block (for $24 a day.)Overall, good but not exceptional enough to make me want to go back. Darrin, the bar steward would make me want to go back though, just for the entertainment value. He was a scream!</text>

The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and we found the room to be satisfactory and clean. This is by no means a luxury hotel, but if you are looking for clean accomodations that present good value in Amsterdam, I highly recommend this hotel. The stairs are difficult to negotiate, so I would not recommend the hotel to those with physical disabilities. Otherwise though, we had a fabulous time, and there is a great restaurant just around the corner from the hotel.</text>

As a single traveller, I was only allowed one pillow on the double bed and one towel in the bath. The ventilation in the lobby was poor so the cigarette smoke was toxic.</text>

		<text>great location Stayed here for a convention at a reduced rate. Room had a high quality 42 inch HD TV and was very comfortable. Excellent location close to Moscone convention center, restaurants, cable car, and shopping. I really enjoyed Yerba Buena Garden right next to it and the bar with a terrific view on the 39th floor. My only complaint is that there are three sets of elevators going to different floors which was confusing for the first day or two. Guests have to transfer elevators to get from certain floors to other floors.</text>

		<text>Excellent value I stayed at the Affinia Dumont on my third business trip to New York, and this is the best hotel value for the money in NYC or anywhere else. It's perfect for those wanting to mix business and pleasure thanks to an enormous desk and Aeron chair as well as a lovely looking spa (I just used the yoga room one morning). Also a well-equiped fitness room, which I didn't need because I walked 6 to 10 miles a day! The elements that made this a standout for me were the excellent lighting (including some energy-efficient fixtures)--especially the reading lights over the bed, over the desk, and by the reading chair--and the great mirrors everywhere you could possibly want them. Overall, including its fully equipped galley kitchen, it's larger than some NYC studio apartments!</text>

		<text>Location the best in San Fransisco....... We stayed at the holiday inn from 6-13 nov 2004,the hotel is an average 3 star but the views from the hotel are second to none. If possible ask for a bay view room on a high floor,the views of the bay are breathtaking. The best thing about this hotel is the location,across the road from Portsmouth Square,the heart of Chinatown,a 5 minute walk to North Beach the Italian district and 15 minutes either direction walking to the shopping district of Civic Square and the tourist thoroughfare of Fisherman,s Wharf,definately 10 out of 10 for location. For breakfast i would reccomend the Garden Restaurant outside the hotel,on the left,as breakfast in the hotel is overpriced and poor,similaly if you need a camera film etc the hotel shop is way overpiced so walk across to Chinatown and get your goods in the shops there. We would stay here again but that is down to the location,the best in San Fransisco,rather than the hotel itself...........</text>

		<text>Nice but noisy Very mixed feelings about this hotel. Don't need to dwell on the positives (look  feel, location, very friendly service) as they're all pretty much covered in the previous reviews.. The big downside is noise. Both from outside the room (the noise from the pool can continue late into the evening), and from the thunderous air conditioning unit which you have no choice but to use, given the heat and humidity of the N.O. summer. Notwithstanding this, I would probably stay here again. But if you're a light sleeper and you're travelling in the summer months, I would recommend you look elsewhere.</text>

I love the sleek design of the rooms (very caribbean modern), the intimate size of the hotel (only 9 rooms), that almost every room has a view of the ocean, the ipod docks in the rooms, the 2 pools (one with a bar where you mix your own drinks!) and the groovy music that plays on the property all day long.

		<text>Fabulous location The Hotel had been recommended by my sister and for a girl travelling on her own , it was fantastic. Located in the heart of the Latin Quarter's restaurant district , it was perfect to eat out and walk safely to hotel , even at night .Needed to close window at night tho' cos can be noisy if you are an early to bed person. Breakfast was fabulous and lovely helpful staff. I felt very secure and like I was in a home away from home .Highly recommend it , especially if a female travelling alone , very secure yet allowed freedom to eat out at night in many places around it .R.R.Australia</text>

		<text>I just loved this hotel!!!!!! We stayed at this hotel while on vacation in L.A. last summer. I was extremely pleased with everything about this hotel, there is not one thing that I could complain about. Ideal location, extra clean, friendly staff, wonderful breakfast buffet, beautiful rooms, etc. This is one place that I would return to over  over again.</text>

		<text>Budget hotel with a very good location Located in the heart of Chinatown, this is a great budget hotel for those who want to have just a place to sleep. The rooms are pretty small, but the bathroon was pretty big comparing to the room. It was mostly clean, except the bedclothes/towels, which could be better. We had a double room with a street view, and it was much lighter, than our friends room, which has only one window with a courtyard view, but it was much more noisy... The front desk is a bit smelly and old, but the staff was nice.</text>
