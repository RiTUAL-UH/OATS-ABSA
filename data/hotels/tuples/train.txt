wonderful hotel wonderful location The Hotel Francois 1er right off the Champs-Elysees is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. The service, rooms, and food are first class and the location couldn't be better! We had a wonderful week. The rooms are beautiful and the service was very efficient. We would definitely return to this this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Sweeping city views This is a great new hotel in San Francisco close to the Convention Centre and the main shopping area. I had the luxury of staying in one of the well appointed junior suites. These are located on the corners of the building so the room has huge floor to ceiling windows on two sides (also extending into the bathroom).The room was huge, complete with iPod docking station, huge flat screen TV and a massive bathroom with a walk-in double shower at one end. All the staff were courteous, especially the cheerful spa staff and my three night stay was very pleasant.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Location and Service Impeccable I stayed here for a convention that was held a few blocks away and was blown away at how incredibly perfect everything was. The price was super reasonable. The service was perfect. The accommodations and amenities left nothing more to be desired (except maybe an indoor pool but not a big deal in my opinion). Not to mention the location was in the dead heart of everything and walking distance to the convention center. I will stay nowhere else when staying downtown SF than the Palomar.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
good choice Stayed here for one night while visiting family. The room was small but clean and comfortable with a good range of toiletries etc. Prior to our stay we had made some requests and the hotel had fulfilled these and we found the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was also excellent, with plenty of choice and fresh foods used. I would certainly stay here again when next in London.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Marriotts have never disappointed me! I just got back, had great Marriott service as I always do and would stay at this one again in a heartbeat. Great fitness center, free internet at the business center, friendly, friendly, helpful staff, very clean room, 5 star service in a 3-4 star hotel. Its also a stone's throw from the Wharf and not noisy. Price was good considering the location (I paid about $200 a night). The staff was always, always, ready to help me out.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Fabulous We stayed at the fantastic Raddisson SAS Berlin over the New Year 04/05 and it's simply one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!!! As soon as you walk in, the aquarium just stuns you with its beauty and size! The staff are attentative and polite and the rooms are superb! The LCD tv's really make a difference and the room design and the 'wet room' style bathrooms are great. The spa is also one of the best! All in all, I have no hesitation in reccomending this wonderful hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
harming, romantic, quaint No complaints. Very, very pleasant accomodating staff. Room was lovely and quite large with a king bed and ultra comfortable mattress. Neither my husband or I felt unsafe in the area even after dark, but I can see if you're somewhat skittish you might be nervous since it isn't a high traffic area like it is right on Union Square. Great shower and vanity and loved the complimentary sodas in the fridge everyday. Will stay there again on our next visit.....####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Stunning hotel and staff! Hotel is uber cool and beautifully decorated in a contemporary style.5 minutes walk from Sol square and tube and also the centre point of Spain!Bar is lovely for a drink and the restaurant looked equally nice but we did not eat there so cant comment on food. Rooms are a bit on the small side though!Staff are VERY attractive and also really nice and helpful. Would definately stay there again but am in no hurry to go back to Madrid.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

clean and New Hotel This is a very new hotel, it is a non-smoking hotel, which was pleasant. The location is very close to the center, tram way is outside the hotel about 1 mins walk, and there is a bike hire place on the basement of the hotel which was very convenient as cycling is one of the easiest way to get around Amsterdam in the day or at night. The room is very big and the toilet is state of the art. Only complain is the free wifi is on the slow side of things. The buffet was really good, and the dinner at the restaurant is nice with very nice view of the river and the other side.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

Frequent return business traveller Having to work away from home in the city is far from ideal and there are few quality hotels within the price range and vicinity of the Apex. The hotel is stylish and well appointed rooms with spacious beds, bathrooms, wide-screen TVs and DVD players make for a comfortable stay. The hotel has a good gym by comparison to other hotels in the area (i.e. More than the usual 3-4 machines).Room service is prompt and food standard is good. The staff are very attentive and professional. To be recommended for the business traveller or tourist.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great Room and nice place to say We only got to stay one night here -- we were on a two week trip out West -- wished we could have stayed longer. The room was WONDERFUL. The hotel was clean, staff was helpful, it was in a great location, just beautiful. We walked to the Diamondbacks game. Great place to stay, would definitely recommend it.

Great Resort Despite the coldest weekend in 16 years, we had a FABULOUS time at the JW Desert Ridge and barely realized that it was raining and even SNOWING in AZ! The JW did a wonderful job with service and addressing every need we had, and we were impressed from the valet attendant to the bellman to the room service! The grounds were beautiful and well maintained, and there were significant challenges given the temperature changes there. Truly a wonderful experience and would recommend this resort to anyone...that I like!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
>Sent us to other hotel although room was paid already I reserved one room for my last night (21.01) in 10 days trip around Florida and for my surprise the staff told me they did not have rooms free although I had already reserved and paid the room through expedia 2 weeks before. The excuse was that some guests had spoiled some rooms, but I think they had overbooking and sent us to the Villa Capri (5 star officially, but really 3 star quality) that is just in front of Riu, but not right on the beach. They offered us free breakfast for 3 people next day and the right to use their pool, but I do not think they are serious people as they MUST respect paid reservations. On the other side the hotel seems nice and is well located close to the beach and Lincoln Rd.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Amazing Park Plaza Wallstreet Berlin it is a lovely hotel, very well located, although not a lively neighbourhood the most important sites (Alexanderplatz,Nikolai Viertel,Bradenburg Tor etc) are within 15-20min walk and the metro station is 1min from the hotel entrance ,there is also a nightbus coming from Alexanderplatz.the hotel is amazing, an old impressive building totally modernised in the inside, the staff is very helpful and kind, and the rooms are simply wonderful, with the high ceiling, the nice decoration and the most unbelievably comfortable bed i ever slept in in a hotel.well done park plaza####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Great hotel, great location and good value We spent a lovely weekend at the hotel set in this quiet oasis in the middle of Madrid. Good value, nicely finished rooms and good quality public areas. Not only were the breakfasts good with lots of choice to suit all tastes, but we also would recommend that you do not miss the the afternoon tea in the bar - something we did not expect in down-town Madrid. All of the staff that we met were friendly and could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Worthy of the Praise All we can do is echo the praise that other reviewers have bestowed upon this wonderful oasis. What an endearing spot! We felt welcome from the moment we arrived via the tiny elevator until the time of our all too soon departure. The other reviews accurately describe the warm and friendly atmosphere of this gem. We would stay at the Colomba again in a heartbeat and strongly encourage all to do the same.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
>Never again! Two nights - never again! No aircondition, sloppy service, unsafe neigborhood, extrem noisy hallways (doors automatically slam shut), I could go on and on and on.

Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed here at the end of September and the beginning of October for 9 nights. This hotel is good value for money, we booked a partial sea view room which was clean and tidy. The location of the hotel is great just across the road from the beach with plenty of reastaurants and shops nearby. The only real downside to this hotel is that the swimming pool is small and does'nt see much of the sun.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
great location, design hotel A lovely modern hotel in a great location, on a wide, very smart shopping boulevard in the centre. Also about 30 seconds from the (underground) train station to the airport (25 mins).Apart from the usual complaints about working the lights/blinds, and flooding the bathroom with the shower, we really enjoyed the room and our stay. Booked through the hotel website which gave us a free breakfast. We were at the back, and didn't hear any noise apart from a little from the corridor.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Brilliant hotel I spent two nights at Calzaiuoli at the end of last month and can't fault it. It's location is superb and although I was worried it would be noisy because it's so central, we weren't disturbed all night. The breakfast is exactly what you expect and perfectly good with lots of hot, strong coffee. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Florence and this one is definitely up there with my favourite, the Antica Torre, but this one is definitely more affordable. The perfect base from which to explore Florence.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

A Great Base of Operations for Uptown Manhattan I was a bit concerned about staying at the Marquis right up until the moment we checked in. Our stay could not have been any better. Decent sized room for NYC, very quiet, great bed, helpful staff, excellent bars and restaurants, and the most efficient elevator system I have ever seen in a high rise hotel.

Then i started to worry about where l was staying, but it was all good,the rooms are tired and bathrooms need renovating but you are hardly ever in your room we had a partial ocean view on the 11th floor it was very relaxing good buffet breakfast included and so close to everything.

New York's finest hotel This is the best hotel in New York - over the years i have stayed in many for business and pleasure, but if you are spending your own money and want value and a lovely place to stay, this is the place. We had a park view room and waking up was a pleasure. indeed the curtains were never shut. What sets this hotel apart is the location and the extra amenities - the bar is one of the best in NY and the concierge can't help enough and it's all done unintrusively.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Fantastic hotel, staff very helpfull and polite rooms spotless and central location superb, within walking distance of all attractions just a short walk down to the marina, the tour bus stops just up the street (鈧?20 / person all day unlimited travel). Travelled from the airport on the service bus ~ 鈧? per couple returned by Taxi ~ 鈧?25-30. Glass of carva on arrival and the breakfast was very good (if a little expensive).

Great Location, Great Staff, Rooms a little Small (but hey, it's Paris) The location was great (facing the Pantheon, close to the Metro) and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We'll stay again nexy time we're in Paris. The only minor negative is that the rooms are awfully small (huge beds make it even worse). You can pay more and get larger rooms so that may be a good option.

Excellent value I stayed in the hotel from 23-24 December. An excellent stay, nice spa, good food, very friendly staff and quite affordable. Check all the websites for offers, the prices I found varied 40 EUR per night.

Hotel Allessandra was great We just returned from a 10 day stay in Italy with 3 wonderful evenings spend at the Hotel Alessandra. I highly recomend this quaint, perfectly located hotel. just 2 blocks from the Uffizzi and one block north of the Arno, the location is perfecto. More importanly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The service stands out as some of the best I have experience-the staff was very outgoing and knowledgeable with recommendations for meals.

Enjoyed the Orchard Experience Booked this Hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The Hotel is small but very reasonably priced for the area. The rooms are very comfortable and we had great nights sleep, didn't eat in hotel as was abit pricey for our liking, they did recommend very good eating places nearby that suited our requirements perfectly. Overall we were very pleased with this accommodation, and would choose to stay here again.

Fantastic pools, shame about teh beach replenishment Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in October 2008, and whilst the rooms were pretty bland the pools and outside areas facing the beach are lovely. 3 pools - one infinity, one with a pool bar and a spa pool. The hotel is right on the beach but the beach was being replenished during our stay so you couldn't actually use it and had to walk to the main Kuta beach (about 5 - 10 minutes).

The only thing that the hotel could improve on was seating in the main lobby--there is a couple of chairs and a couch and alot of empty space.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities comfort', 'neutral']]
Great at the IC I was in New Orleans for business and truly enjoyed my sta at the IC. The location was the best and the service excellent.

Excellent location and view! I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotel's location, new decorum view from our 21st level room and a complementary breakfast in the early morning before our tour. I haven't visited Waikiki Beach in decades and this overnight was a great way to end our week in Hawaii. Stacey and Agnes at the Expedia Desk were extremely helpful - booking a Pearl Harbor Tour and a last minute shuttle to the airport.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
agree with previous re bedrooms I agree with the previous review- the bedrooms let the hotel down - there is obviously a variety of bedrooms. Our first bedroom was on the fourth floor at the back with a view of the inner courtyard - would have been fine if the room had not been so hot. Complained and told that this room did not have air-conditioning - moved to the room previously described with floor level windows and air-conditioning. Otherwise the hotel was excellent including the breakfast and location.####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Excellent hotel but can get expensive Hotel was clean and service was excellent. Restaurants in the motel are expensive so go out to eat. Hotel is classy with a beautiful lobby and front desk area. Beach area is shared with other hotels so it can crowded early. We do not recommend the dinner cruises, they are over rated and over priced, do a luai instead. Hotel is recommended and if you get room 1609 you will have a good ocean view without paying for it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Excellent I stayed here for 1 night on 20 Feb 07 whilst on business. Although outside is not particularly special my twin bedded room was excellent. Spotlessly clean and large, with seperate power shower, bath and loo with bidet. All staff were extremely welcoming and polite, especially the English 'bellboy' working 7-15h.

Excellent I stayed there with a mate having arrived after 15hrs on planes from New York, Madrid and Barcelona. The staff were friendly and welcoming right from the start, with plenty of charm and good humour (which we found unusual in Spain on the whole)! Rooms were very clean and well maintained. It's in a great location for the night-life (ramblas) and was within easy walking distance of good bars, resturants, and other attractions. I'lld recomend this mainly for younger people, singles or couples as the nightlife in the immediate area is vibrant to say the least. Overall, a great hotel with excellant service, presentation and modern amenities, would stay there again without doubt.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive']]
Great location Stayed here for a weekend in mid-November. Hotel was fine - very good location, close to bars, restaurants, canal boat tours centraal station - it was clean and efficient and we had no complaints. We had read previous reviews and knew what to expect - despite the Crowne Plaza brand this is three star/travel inn standard (not the four star advertised) - so find a good deal  only pay three star prices!

Perfect Location... Fun Hotel Just returned from a two-night stay at the Triton, and I have to say my experience was in contrast to that of some of the other reviewers who felt there was a lack of restaurants in the neighborhood or that the staff wasn't helpful enough. We received excellent recommendations for dining in the neighborhood (Taylor St., Ryoko and Le Colonial) both nights of our stay from helpful concierge, Nick. Add to that a perfect location -- practically in Chinatown, right next to Union Square, and convenient to the waterfront--and a fun decor. It's true that some facilities could use better upkeep (e.g., plumbing), but for the price, I would go back to Triton again in a heartbeat.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral']]

expensive for what it gives It's not really bad, but does not give value for money. When arriving at SFO airport, I called the shuttle line and was told that it would take about 10-12 minutes. I have seen all other hotel shuttles twice, before the Sheraton one arrived. The staff is friendly enough. I had diner there too, which was quite good, but the temperature in the restaurant was rediculously hot.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Benchmark in Hospitality My fiancee and I flew down to SF from Canada and were extremely impressed with the decorum and class of this hotel. From the elevator completely covered in pages from old books, the complimentary Aveda shampoo (my fiancee was particularly fond of this), timely valet service, and exemplary service, staying at Hotel Rex made our stay in SF a flawless experience.

Good hotel, problem with a burger I stayed here after a Red River Shootout, and it was good. The room was cozy and it was easy to access.

Superb! My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights (and mornings and afternoons) at Matteo's beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal. His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated, and treat each other, like old friends. The wonderful terrace, for breakfast and evening spritzers and whatever else you'd like, provides the remarkable setting. Although near the Rialto bridge, serenity reigns. Al Ponte Antico is a magical place and we will return again and again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

I liked the Mosser The Mosser is a very clean, comfortable, friendly, attractive hotel that's in a great location in San Francisco. It's also inexpensive. The only drawbacks - which are no secret - are that the rooms are small (although very well arranged) and the bathrooms are shared (or at least mine was).

OK, but The hotel is located ideally for tourism. If they offer you a room around by the pool, DO NOT TAKE IT!! These rooms are not refurbished, noisy surroundings (generartors etc).

Avoid at all costs How this place can call itself a 4.5/5 star hotel is beyond me - obviously the management have no grasp of hospitality unless they previosuly ran a prison or similar.

Lovely My friends and I stayed here for four nights over the St Patricks day period. Our rooms were on the 36th floor, really nice rooms, very clean and modern, maid service every day. The only thing I would fault would be, some of the reception staff are quite rude, and keep an eye on your bill with the bar staff, if they are serving at your table, keep tabs of what you had as they do seem to try to add drinks on that you haven't had, or imply you haven't paid! This also happened to another couple who were staying there the same time as us!Apart from that, good location and a lovely hotel, would stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great central hotel We have just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam staying at the Hotel Eden. After reading previous reviews on Trip Advisor we didnt know what to expect but the Hotel couldnt have been better. We stayed on the 5th floor in a lovely clean room with the most comfortable bed and pillows ever! The staff were friendly  helpful and the hotel is in a great location. Would definitely stay agai####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
mfortable, Clean,  Stayed at the Ohana West from 1/22-1/29/05, was pleasantly surprised after reading many mixed reviews. We had a city/mountain view, king room, on the 16th floor with a nice size lanai, the room was a little small, but clean and comfortable. The daily housekeeping service was very prompt and did a very good job, and all the staff at the hotel demonstrated excellent customer service. The location of this hotel is perfect, it is centrally located to all the great things to do in Oahu. If your looking for a 5 star hotel this is not the place, but if your looking for a nice place with reasonable rates and great service, then this is the place to stay.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Excellent hospitality Our large group discovered the Europa via Trip Advisor, and all the previous positive reviews are spot on. The Europa doesn't seem to appear in any guidebooks, and the entrance lobby downstairs is unpromising, but once you arrive in the hotel, Gassim and his daughter Miriam are wonderfully discreetly attentive hosts. The rooms at the back are quiet and elegantly furnished, and the hotel is perfectly placed - a couple of minutes' walk from the Duomo. Our group of 13 stayed for a week, and felt we really had found a home from home.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['polarity positive', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great hotel I've stayed here 3 times and every time it was great. The room was spacious and the hotel is across the road from the train station. If you're travelling by train, this is definitely the hotel for you. There are also international calling booths across the road at the train station and a post office to send souveniers to your family and friends, just across the road. Breakfast was great and there is free internet.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Beautiful Hotel in the Middle of Tokyo After staying in the Akasaka Excel Hotel, we moved to the Prince because it was cheaper and are we glad we did! The Prince is a beautiful hotel with big, modern rooms (some with a panaoramic view of Tokyo). The service was also excellent and the price was excellent. We never ate there as there are many local dining options just down the street. Highly recommended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great break Arrived on the Saturday afternoon, pleasant staff greeted us. We were shown to our room via going through the famous garage area. We stayed on the fifth floor, i can honestly say that our room was very clean had working aircon and a safety deposit box. I do not have one complaint to make about the hotel, considering it only cost me 拢112.00 for three nights stay with breakfast i think that i came out of it very well.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Unbelievably friendly staff - highly recommend Excellent hotel - service beyond our wildest dreams. Osam and his staff was really friendly, helpful and accommodating. They treated our children like royalty for our short stay, and we really appreciate that. The steps up to reception look daunting, but it adds to the authenticity of the building in my view. The only downside was the weather, and I can't blame the hotel for that!!!####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Pleasantly surprised Very close to airport, staff kindly checked me in very early and after I freshened up pointed me in the right direction to the main centre. There is a 4 storey outlet mall attached and MTR right next door. 20minutes and in Kowloon. Room was unexpectedly ample, well fitted out and great value.

venient, helpful  I stayed here as a single female and it was a great place to be. The concierge was able to recommend great restaurants and trips, and the hotel is right next to lots of the sights, and the cable car turnaround so it's easy to get anywhere.

I loved this hotel I have stayed in Le Meridien chain a lot and have never been disappointed. This one was no exception.

Excellent Expereince - Great Service The hotel was amazing. The Decor was really modern and nice, The hotel was clean and beds were confortable. The staff very helpful, they directed us on how to save hundreds on show tickets, where most hotels would only offer you there services, stadd multiple times showed us the best options which were outside the hotels services.

Excellent stay at Casablanca Casablanca is the perfect location for those who wish a central location and like to walk to get around. Everything was closeby including an off Broadway play. Restaurants in the immediate area were great. The staff at Rick's Cafe and at the front desk were very helpful and extremely enjoyable to spend a few minutes chatting with. We requested a quiet room and enjoyed a restful sleep every night which we thought amazing because of the close proximity to Time Square.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
School Group I brought a group of middle school students to stay here on June 3-6, 2004. The stay was fantastic. I really appreciated that there was hotel staff located on ground and then again in the hotel lobby checking to be sure that only registered guests were entering the hotel. The front desk staff, housekeepers, concierge, security, and porters were all very nice to the kids. The price of the hotel is on the moderate to high side but the location (1/2 block to the Times Square subway station), experience, and high quality made it worth it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved the building stayed for one night in july. Excellent location close to airport, walking distance to Van Gogh Museum and lots of nice restaurants and Terraces around the hotel. Staff is the most helpfull I have seen. Internet connection in the room is expensive, but there is a PC with internet connection near the reception that can be used for free.

ustomer Service is amazing! When it comes right down to it, the Renew is a great place to stay because of the attitude of the staff who take customer service very seriously and did everything that they could to make my one week stay comfortable. The Renew still needs to renew their air conditioner units which are aging and a little week. On the whole, a great place to stay. Such a nice alternative to places like the Hilton.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Room with a view Lovely reception staff and lovely room we stayed in with a view of a Duomo (not the main one). Very new bathroom. Lift access, 24 hour reception.

Great stay I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous.

Breakfast was good with different choices and we could come in to the hotel at anytime of the day or night because of the day and night receptionists.

Great location and spacious room Can't argue with the location (short walk to Universal Studios, short drive to Hollywood and downtown), or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom. Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day (you will need time to explore LA). Only downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access. Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances. Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced (extra to cost of room) Overall, pretty good, just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]
blissful retreat It was a while ago, but we adored Uma Sapna. Having our own pool was fabulous. On the downside it IS quite a long walk from the beach/restaurants etc, especially in the dusty heat.

To be honest though, once you have found a place to eat, ordered juice, coffee and say crambled eggs you have pretty much spent that anyway so it is probably worth it as its a buffet.bar in hotel nice to start in or have a drink before bed.if you stay in the front of the hotel - the windows are transparent!we stayed with two children and hotel was fi####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

I thought it was very nice there where only 3 things i would watch out for : People with a royal shirt they try to sell you stuff, the vendors they chase after you so you will buy there stuff and the costant music playing but other than that it was great the beach is lovely the pool is a perfect temperature and the swim up bar is great!

Great small hotel in the old town There can't be many hotels on earth owned by such a fascinating man as this one. The rooms are all equipped not only with everything you need for a very comfortable (and affordable) stay, but also with copies of the owner's writings - thoughts, reflections and words of wisdom, a kind of cross between Khalil Gibran and Marcus Aurelius. He himself is an inspired and inspiring presence, and a stay in his wonderful, charmed hotel is capable of changing the course of a person's life. There are testimonies on the internet to this effect. It seems he will drop everything for a deep conversation with a guest. The hotel also has a wonderful rooftop bar and restaurant, which is great place to catch the evening light and eat excellent local gourmet food.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Great hotel, great service I was impressed by all aspects of the Affinia 50. Sophistication without the attitude, which is so hard to find. When I was concerned about how to find a particular restaurant by cab, the person at the front desk found the restaurant in the NYC Zagat guide and made a copy of the listing for me. The service from the bell staff was equally terrific. I can't wait to return!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
New Cliff Vilas best in Bali We spent seven nights there over Easter and stayed in the new Cliff Vilas. For under $US600 a night incl breakfast, it was extraordinary value for money. The vilas are the size of a house, with a large and magnificent private pool, cabana, grounds, living room and bathroom that is equal in size to half the vila. You see the ocean from every room, the butler was great and whilst the staff were not the most efficent in the world, their efforts and kindness make up for it. 10 out of 10.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

It is clean, well kept with minimalist modern decor and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The location is also great, about 10 minutes walk from the bars at Port Olympic.

OK Location but noisy rooms Hotel Balmes looks very plush from outside and in the reception area, however we were in room 13 and it was very dark and also very noisy, didn't get too much sleep during our stay. Our room was spacious though and had a seating area as well as sleeping area and nice bathroom. The walk to Placa Catalunya was about 20 minutes I would say, which was further than I had originally thought, but it was easy to find our way around. Didn't have breakfasts at the hotel. Used the garden area, but not the pool although it did look very tempting, but the weather wasn't really warm enough.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]

I had a number of cards and left the saleslady approximately equivalent of $14+ US dollars for the postage. While cards mailed from other locations across China, arrived at their destinations, not one of the cards left in the hotel gift shop were ever received.####[['hotel general', 'positive']]
Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great if it weren't for the desk staff Beds, location and cleanliness were excellent. HOWEVER, the front desk screwed up a simple Kinkos delivery for me, and my traveling companion's reservation- then tried assigning blame on him despite his ability to produce confirmation numbers and dates. All ended well, but customer service was AMAZINGLY bad. Probably fine for tourist travel, but be warned that for business travel this is the worst Starwood property we've ever stayed in.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
harming, quaint hotel in central SF location If you're looking to stay at a very charming, quaint hotel, then try Laurel Inn. The lobby and sitting area are comfortable, and the rooms are simply furnished and looked retro. There was nothing pretentious about the staff or the services. They were very helpful in directing us around the city to restaurants. It was a no-frills boutique hotel that felt like home, and that was the best part.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Look no further for your Sydney stay If you're looking for a comfortable, central hotel then look no further. Our room was well proportioned and clean, staff went out of their way to help us and our three year old daughter. Slap bang in the middle of everything tourist wise, it's about a ten minute stroll from Circular Quay and five minutes from Darling Harbour. Can't recommend this enough!!####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Excellent Hotel My wife and I just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Regina in Barcelona. This hotel is highly recommended. It is very convenient to the main shopping street; the room that we had (#403) was situated at the front of the hotel - it was very comfortable and quiet; the staff is friendly and very accommodating - making dinner reservations, reconfirming air reservations, etc. I would definetely stay at this hotel should we make a return visit to Barcelona.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
The quiet jewel in the quarter Was apprehensive about staying in the French Quarter with the sounds of a party echoing from Bourbon Street. But found this small hotel, only 1/2 block off of Bourbon, to be a quiet jewel. With a good hotels amenities and a friendly and helpful staff, I found myself able to complete my buisness and enjoy some of the nightlife made famous by Bourbon Street. I highly recommend the Hotel Saint Marie for buisness or pleasure.####[['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Obsessed with this hotel! We got a great deal on Orbitz for this amazing hotel. The location is outstanding, smack between the Duomo and Piazza Signoria. We had a room facing the back, from which we could open our windows to overlook the picturesque Florentine rooftops and an overwhelming view of the Duomo itself! Our room was huge; comfortable and modern furniture, a very clean and beautiful bathroom (maybe a tad on the small side) but a separate sitting room with a sofa/twin bed and separate TV with its own amazing view. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Friendly, helpful staff The best part of Casci is the staff. They were very helpful with recommendations- directions, restaurants, etc. This was our second hotel in Florence, and compared to the first, Casci had a little more of a hostel kind of feel- signs in the bathroom asking you not to clean your laundry in the sink, for example. This was the quietest of all hotels we stayed at, which was nice. The location was great- down the street from the Duomo, street markets, and within walking distance of the train station.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Very good breakfast and the one evening meal we had there was first class too.

A really lovely hotel in a lovely district close to all Hotel Monge was a lovely place to stay - really great value for a long weekend to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. Staff were very helpful, location amazing and metro so close - although Notre Dame and Latin Quarter was only 15 minutes walk. Mouffetard was a lovely district up very closeby, with great bars and restaurants - we loved 1001 Nights Morrocan bar with hooker pipes and Avocado milk shakes!

Loved the hotel 5 of my girlfriends and I have just returned from Punta Cana and overall our visit was quite pleasant. The weather was great. The hotel was very nice, spacious and it had many options as far as food and restaurants. We highly recommend the restaurant 'La Res' - the food was superb.

Should ne upgraded to a 4 star + I recently stayed 3 nights in this hotel with my mother and have to say we couldn't have picked a better hotel. I have stayed in many a four star hotel in Italy but none compare to this hotel. The staff were fantastic always on hand to offer friendly advice from where to go on day trips to which Restaurant to eat in. We stayed in room 501 which had a fantastic view and a good size balcony. I am planning to go back to Florence in September and would definately stay in the same hotel and with a bit of luck the same room.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Not too bad Having stayed here a number of times in the past the hotel is beginning to show wear a bit. Staff were pleasant and helpful throughout which is always as I have found it. The room facilities are as you would expect and the rooms are quite spacious (from a European point of view).I like this hotel because of it's proximity to the Central Rail Station where I can get into and out of the Airport quickly without relying on a taxi (or other transport).Food is of a reasonably good standard for breakfast. The Restaurant is highly regarded for it's Dutch food. The hotel is close to the nightlife centres without being on top of them - Dam Sq being about 5-10 mins walk.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Great location This hotel is in a great location in terms of a walking distance to key Fisherman's Wharf attractions. From the Wharf area you can catch a trolley car or sightseeing bus to other parts of the City. Overall the hotel is great for the value.

Nice place to stay The Residence Michalangiolo has fantastic rooms, and is run by the nicest freindliest people you could hope to meet. It is easy walking distance to the centre of Florence or there is a great inexpensive bus service. As there is no restarant and bar if you are hoping to meet other guests this hotel is not for you, but with a hotplate and fridge cleverly hidden in the room it is great if you want to do your own thing.

The hotel is very conveniently located to the airport and downtown and is just a short cab ride to all the action in South Beach.

Great hotel I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great. Room was very small but was perfect for us, it had all we needed including a minibar and a very nice bathroom. We stayed for three nights in total, it may be a bit small for people on a longer stay (1 week).As mentioned in other reviews, it have a more of a BB feel than a hotel feel so if you are looking for somewhere more like a hotel then I would look elsewhere.

Met or exceeded ALL expectations! We are a family of four (two adults and two daughters, ages 18  20). We stayed in one of the apartments for five nights and in two of the hotel rooms for one night. Only one negative to report--the new paint fumes in the hotel rooms on our last night. Other than that, I STRONGLY recommend this property.

Did not love the Chealsea Lodge First of all, I rely on Trip Advisor for my traveling. The room that I stayed in was horribly small. The TV didn't get great reception, the shower kept going from scalding to freezing, and there was a huge pipe in the room that kept whistling like a tea kettle. The cleaning staff was very friendly. However, when we explained to the problem with our room (whistling pipe), they were not willing to accommodate us at all.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
A Beautiful Place in a Very Good Location Stayed here for three nights in June 2008, 2 adults and 2 teenagers in the annex rooms, second (third) floor. An absolutely beautiful place, clean and new with real Venetian decor (go to the Ca'Rezzonico museum and see the same style furniture you have in your room!). Breakfast was very good featuring home made apple croissants. I am a super light sleeper and on the first night heard noises from the private residence above our room - Walter and Sandro at the front desk contacted owner of the building the next day and immediately resolved the issue, they were super nice and helpful. Not hard to walk to this hotel from the train station - save some money on the overpriced vaporetto tickets and head there on foot.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Good for a Stop over We had a somewhat small room in the 鈥渢ower鈥?section of the hotel, which I think is mainly used by stopover passengers en route to Australia. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was very clean and welcoming. Wardrobe space was somewhat limited after luggage storage and the small sit in bath required careful negotiation in order to stand in a flat area for a shower. The room although small was pleasant enough but the lighting was very poor and I found it very difficult to read standard size font (such as 11 of 12 point) after it had got dark.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Good hotel, good location Stayed here for a few on nights on way to Sydney in November 04. Like a lot of other reviewers, i thought the room was small but in a place like Hong Kong you shouldn't be spending too much time there. Staff were friendly and helpful and some good info from the tourist desk. About 10 minutes walk from the busy streets of Causeway Bay, but 30 seconds from the MTR station and trams which are cheap and reliable (buy an Octupus card at the airport!).Tremendous, mainly unrestricted views over Hong Kong, harbour and Kowloon from the rooftop pool. Restaraunt a bit pricey, but reasonable value European/Asian buffet breakfast. No problems at night with karoke - although Bridge Over Troubled Water in Cantonese is interesting.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'conflict']]

Excellent Staff Excellent hotel for the price. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Everyone speaks English. The hotel itself is very good, if you don't mind the staircase leading to it.

We will surely stay in that hotel next time.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Bad I stayed in this hotel in early March, although the location is excellent, we will not return to this hotel. We checked in at 2:30pm and the room was not ready. The room is nice but it is dusty. We had breakfast there in the morning, the food was cold and not replenished, very disappointing.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]
Truly amazing Returned on 12th June - it was fabulous. Even better than the photos!In addition to all the things other people say in their reviews aboutthe pool, drinks, food, luxury room etc, I especially liked the beautiful design of the resort and lovely touches like the wonderful selection of colourful plants and flowers, parrots, flamingos, fish etc. We also enjoyed the poolside activities eg Spanish lessons, Aqua Aerobics - thanks to the activity team who did a great job. My only complaint would be the Thomas Cook rep who was hopeless and the MyTravel flights to/from London Gatwick which were the most uncomfortable flights I've ever had the misfortune to take.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
ice city shame about the hotel we stayed for 1 week in August 4-11th,2008, found hotel to be showing its age ,Doormen and staff very polite and courteous. But as a show Hotel for Boston ,I think it could do with some updating. As some people have said it is surrounded by some good buildings ,such as Trinity church and the Library,but is overshadowed by the monster skyscraper of the Hancock tower. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends or family as I believe more modern hotels exist in the city. What I can say is we experienced some history that the hotel showed in its makeup.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'neutral']]
very good value We visited Berlin in June 2004 and found the hotel very clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were larger than expected and great value for money. The hotel was within walking distance of Alexanderplatz where there is a very efficient metro system serving most areas of Berlin. In the evenings we visited some bars within walking distance of the hotel but admittedly hard to find which were open very late. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great location, friendly family-run hotel Nice family-run hotel in a great location - just a couple blocks from the Duomo, Galleria dell'Accedemia, and close to many other sites (although I do recommend taking a taxi from the train station if you have luggage - cost is only about 8 Euro from the train station to the hotel). The owners and staff are extremely accomodating, offering good advice to restaurants (their recommendation of Za Za's Tratorria was so good we went back our last night), tours and anything else you need to know. They made reservations for us for dinner and a tour and we were happy with each. They take pride in making sure everyone enjoys their stay.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great Value! Aparthotel Silver is a good, clean, tourist class hotel in a quiet neighbourhood just north of the city centre. It provides excellent value compared with central hotels and offers a great buffet breakfast. Staff are friendly and helpful. Transport links are brilliant - the hotel is 80m from the metro station (Fontana) and then 5 minutes from the heart of the city (Line 3).####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]

classy hotel Classy hotel, in a classy part of barcelona, near to all the sights, a bit of a walk to las ramblas so a bit further away from the party scene. very helpful staff, rooms very tastefully decorated with nice bathrooms. turn down service and a pillow menu! some of the rooms do differ considerably in size though, maybe ask for a larger room,,also the rooftop pool is only really aplunge pool but the rooftop is lovley to sit out and have a few relaxing drinks.breakfast very expensive!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

Perpetual Guest We first found this hotel four years ago. Although the rooms are small, the privacy, ambience and staff more than make up for the lack of space. The bar, restaurant and reading room are unique and welcomed in an ever busy non-personal transit world of the traveller.

Bad hotel, good location This is clearly not a 3 star hotel ! The staff is rather unpleasant, decoration is inexistant, rooms are tiny and beds are too soft, no air conditioning in the rooms which are just under the rooftop, and to finish breakfast is mediocre (no croissants or pancakes only bread, no choice in fruit juices etc...). The only good point is its location right on the Dam place.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative']]
Lovely hotel, brilliant location I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Brilliant location, loads of nice restuarants near to the Lodge and close enough to mid and downtown to make it easy to get everywhere else. Yes the rooms are small but they are perfectly adequate especially if you are planning to be out most of the time. Toilets were never busy and the whole place was clean and beautifully finished.

Great Hotel My husband and I loved this hotel.

no problem with me I hesitated to book a room in this hotel because of the mixed opinions posted below, but I went on to reserve one mainly because of its location (undoubtedly the closest hotel from the central station).

The breakfast was rather expensive (20euro), so I chose to get food outside.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['polarity positive', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Loved our Spaulding Hotel Very good location, centrally located close to Theaters and shopping. We were given a nice quiet room on the 6th floor overllooking the pool of the adjacent hotel property. We traveled with our teenage daughter who enjoyed being close to the hip boutiques such as HM, Urban Ourfitter and Forever 21. The room had hard wood floors and was clean and cosy. The lounge on the second floor was really convenient and had washers and dryers which was super.

Affordably Elegant If you don't need an elevator, this is a wonderful find in the Queen Anne district near Seattle Center.

Great Place to Stay We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton 3 nights from July 1st. That was the second time we've stayed at the Sheraton and like the first time, we enjoyed our stay very much.

A Doggie Hotel, Not for People The smell and stains in hallways and in rooms tells everything..... this hotel caters to people with dogs. We checked into our room and the stench of dog with potent cleaning solution smell practically knocked us over. The staff was friendly and tried to accommodate, but they said there weren't any rooms that were designated for just people. So if you don't mind paying to stay in a room where dogs have obviously been, then Summerfield may be just the place for you.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

problems in paradise I was travelling on a family gathering in Miami, and my family booked at this hotel previously. I arrived at 2230 on a Thursday and Friday morning enjoyed the breakfast they offered, subsequently we left the hotel around 1430 on Friday and returned at 1600, on return luggage from our room had been stolen. My major concern was the way in which the hotel handled this, the first question they asked was should we call the police? I also noted that on return at least 3 room doors were opened by housekeeping and the rooms unprotected by employees, thus violating their own policy - to get into this hotel you have to go through a gate into a secured compound. My warning is this: the hotel accomodations are nice and pleasant, be very careful about your possessions and use the safe!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Great hotel, shame about the price increase! We enjoyed a fantastic Mother-Daughter trip to Paris in August and were very impressed by the quality/cost ratio of Regent's Garden Hotel. We got a really nice, recently refurbished twin room for only 99 Euro (booked direct on the hotels website).However, rather large negative: A few weeks later, having been so impressed by the hotel that I was planning a second trip back there to stay with my husband, I was told by the hotel that it had just been upgraded from a 3* to a 4* hotel and that subsequently the price has increased from 99 Euros for a Classic room to 169 Euros! A huge increase which dramatically changes the 'value for money' aspect of the hotel. While I would agree that an increase was warranted based on the refurbishment, it does not warrant a 70 Euro increase and it's a real shame as it puts a nice little hotel in the unaffordable category for a lot of people who would previously have stayed here (a comment I made to the hotel).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]

Good location, comfy beds Rooms were great although the bedroom area was a little on the small side, the bathrooms and comfortable beds really made up for this. All sights within easy walking distance - 5 mins walk to the flower market and 15-20 mins to Museumplein. Near to metro, trams and canalbus stops. Just round the corner from the hotel is Utrechtsestraat which contains some of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. During our stay there was a lot of unexpected construction work (both to us and the hotel) which the hotel kindly compensated us for. Would definitely stay here again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great base for seeing LA We were very pleased with our stay at the Holiday Inn Universal Studios (formerly known as the Beverly Garland). Although it is a bit noisy due to proximity to Highway 101, it didn't stop us from sleeping and the proximity to 101 meant driving around was easy.

Elegant Hotel, excellent position, but some minor flaws We stayed here in late September 2003, and would recommend it for position, and its effortless elegance and style. A five minute walk from the Duomo and various excellent side-street restaurants make it a very strong choice. That said, those minor flaws: as in other hotels, rooms vary in quality from tired and jaded to newly refurbished with Tuscan pain effects - so negotiate for the better ones. Breakfast was mediocre with catering being run by an outside conmtractor! Be prepared to part with $25 a day for parking as well. But overall the setting- especially the roof-top bar terrace - gave this a very strong rating.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

Great amenities for the price If you want a first class or corporate hotel in a nondescript cityscape, then stay away from the Perak, instead book at one of the glass and concrete boxes on Orchard Road. The Perak is not like the big chain hotels but is a great value for the money in Singapore. For around $70USD per night you get a clean (albiet small) room, with basic but nice appointments(Cable TV, A/C, DVD, free wireless internet, etc), a good location in vibrant Little India, and basic but tasty buffet breakfast. I had no complaints other than a bit of street noise late at night when a neaby bar was closing up. But the cheapest rooms at the Perak have a skylight rather than a window and are much quieter if noise is an issu####[['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Vibe Hotel and I thought, for price and location, you can't beat it. They had just recently undergone a massive renovation and the rooms were modern and comfortable and included any amenity we could have asked for -- minus complimentary towels at the rooftop pool which was slightly annoying since we called down to housekeeping 3 times and were clearly ignored. So basically, aside from lack of towels at the pool, out stay was comfortable and hassle free and exactly what we were looking for.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Excellent service at a cost Good location on a side road of Orchard Road, but not necessarily the best location as Orchard Road is like Oxford St in London, busy and full of tourists. The service was amazing, using your name when you check in, giving you a butler etc. Rooms are excellent, well appointed and a descent size, pure luxury. Concierge and all the staff very helpful, however I did find the cost of drinks a little on the steep side, as was breakfast.

Decent with good quality/price ratio, but noisy The hotel is in a good location, the rooms, at least the low priced one i got, are really small although you can survive for a week if you just sleep in there. The window in my room was loose and the first two nights it was not properly warm. I tried to put the room temperature regulation on, but the fan was really noisy, so i opted for an extra blanket. My room was facing the rear street and it was rather noisy early in the mornings. On the average, i would suggest this place, at least for the cheap rooms, to the budget conscious traveler.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Mediocre cleaning, mediocre breakfast buffet Was not asked about room preference at check-in and got one stinking with old cigarettes. Happily we were offered a non-smoking room within 30 minutes after we complained. The glasses and cups we used in the room were not changed by the cleaning lady, just wiped off. The breakfast buffet was ok, but not up to the standards one should expect from a 4-star hotel.

Discreet Charms Of The Neri On Tripadvisor comments I booked this hotel for a short 4 day break - we weren't disappointed. It is the perfect small hotel with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Having travelled extensively, far too many hotels rely upon offering a plethora of services that guests will never use. The Neri, in common with good hotels, simply concentrates on providing excellent accomodation where a good nights sleep is guaranteed, excellent assistance from the helpful staff, and a wonderful location for sightseeing. The hotel deserves to succeed.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Must have been in a different hotel than others Seeing all the rave reviews of this place, I must have been at another hotel, there is nothing decent in downtown NO, or its clientele is too young and/or drunk to know any better. Desk service is condescending, except for the sheets rooms are really not well-maintained, carpet is badly stained, and everything is worn-out. Good but noisy location with thin walls. Downstairs breakfast restaurant looks mediocre and expensive, though the night club looks intrguing. Would stay again only if stuck. Tip: Unless the season is very busy, you can probably get very deep discount coupons at Visitor Center, so don't reserve ahead.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

Great Value!! We stayed for 2 nights, and it was better than we expected. Free parking (great bonus), nice neighboorhood with good restaurants and stores, if you need them walking distance, and very friendly service. Walking distance to Fishermans Warf . Good value.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
a warm and intimate hotel in a big city We recently spent a long weekend at The Benjamin. I have to agree with all the previous positive posts. The location is good, the room was great, the bed comfortable, the staff friendly without exception. The only problem was that our refrigerator did not work properly and they were not able to fix it during our stay. We plan to stay at The Benjamin again soon.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Reviews are right on for this one We stayed at the Cancellor Hotel in July during part of our honeymoon. The reviews on this website are right on spot regarding the hotel. The hotel is older and the rooms are smaller but very clean and the staff is very helpful. They made our honeymoon special with champagne and a gift in our room at check in. On a side note, we loved the restaurant next door for breakfast called Sears.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
AWFUL HOTEL! There is no way this is a 4.5 star hotel, more like a 1 star. The room was big, but dirty walls and horrible lighting. Very noisy and very uninformed staff. It has completely made me not want to ever stay at a Radisson Hotel again.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
wonderfully comfortable We stayed for three nights April 2004. The room was very spacious and comfortable in every way. Enormous choice at the huge buffet breakfast and the best pool/ sauna/ health club we had ever used. Near all the sights-- if a little qiet at night but all in all a luxurious place to stayin a great location.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Service in the desk is good and with a smile .De breackfast is tasteful , with all that's necessary to start the day with a good feeling.

very good experience at this hotel Stayed for 2 nights while touring through Texas. Located to the north of the city but convenient for attractions (if you have a car). we did the JFK museum in downtown Dallas before heading over to Fort Worth Stockyards and then to Southfork Ranch so you can do these attractions in a day from this base. Nice restaurants and other facilities. Excellent well appointed room at very competitive rate. Overall a very good experience and would recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
Nice hotel, great price for NY Stayed in the Sofitel June 28-30 2003. The Sofitel is in a very good location, one block from Times Square. The rates are very good, try Expedia or their website. The room had a very comfortable queen bed, with turndown service and a nice bathrobe. The bathroom was large and clean, with good toiletries. I plan to stay here again on my return trips to NY.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Satisfied I stayed here for 3 nights. Check in was brisk and the room was adequate - neat, not too large yet not too small (considering this is Hong Kong). Location was good, near the hustle and bustle of Times Square. For everything else, there is always the MTR!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Good Hotel Booked a package through Eurostar, a nice modern hotel near the peripeherique, 5 mins walk to the metro and then 15 mins into the centre of Paris. In the centre of conference / tradeshow town so could be busy. A good room, clean and tidy and attentive staff. A check in problem was expertly and politely solved. bar expensive and you are better off taking breakfast in a local bar than the hotel (15 euro buffet anyone?). Recommended for a long weekend, we'll stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great Little Boutique Hotel! The Hotel Londra is a beautiful little hotel with great accommodations, excellent service by the hotel staff, and the best dinner that we had in Italy was at the restaurant in this Hotel. Breakfast is served each morning, with a generous choice of bakery, meat, egg, fruit, and drink choices. While the location is a bit of a walk from the center of town, we enjoyed walking and seeing the community every bit as much as we enjoyed all of the historic sites. Our room was clean, spacious, and we enjoyed a magnificent view which was perfect at sunset. We will definitely stay at the Hotel Londra the next time we are in Florence.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Fantastic location We stayed here for one night on the 3rd leg of our Honeymoon and it was fantastic, we had a suite with a little kitchen and a lounge and a large bedroom. We were travelling with our 7 year old little girl. The location was great as it was only a 10 - 15 min walk to the CN Tower which was great. In the morning we received a complementary breakfast which was great and it set us up for the day. Would definatly stay here if we returned to Toronto.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Value for money The location is excellent right next to Centraal Station. The rooms are small but cleanBreakfast is adequateFree Porn channel for those interested. To sum up it is what it is a cheap hotel at a cheap price. If you want a luxorious hotel pay more and get one if you just want a nice clean cheap room in an excellent location. This is for you.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Fantastic service I am a travel agent booking hotels all over the world, so we are very very fussy. This hotel offers customer service at its' best. Great location, great service, nothing is too much bother. The rooms are great, cheaper than some of the well known names and frankly far better. Stay here and give yourself a treat with staff who really do genuinely care. We will continue to book our clients here, as it gives a great satisfaction to offer them such an outstanding property.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Lovely hosts, but catered towards Americans The hotel is quaint with a lovely terrace and nice hosts, but seemed as if this place was more geared towards americans, with some surprise at guests that are not americans (i.e. us). This is probably due to the american wife of the owner couple. Unfortunately this made the hotel seem less diverse, whereas Florence is very diverse!!The rooms are large, but some features such as bathrooms do need updating. Breakfast is not included, which is a shame as many hotels in Italy offer it.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Loved It After reading the reviews on this site, I was terrified of my choice, but had already paid in full through Expedia. The hotel turned out better than I expected and I completely relaxed. Room was charming, although it was the absolute smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in, and the bathroom was really itty bitty!Didn't have much contact with the staff, but what contact I did have was pleaseant. I arrived at the hotel at 11 a.m. was allowed to check in, which helped me enjoy a full day in San Francisco without worrying about check in times, etc. I took Bart from the airport and highly recommend it over taking a $40 or more taxi ride.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Excellent Not much more to say. I'm pretty picky about hotels but this a great place in every way. I agree with the last reviewer about not wanting too many people to find out about this place. Location is pretty much next to the Accademia and not far from the Duomo. Service is great and the people working at the desk are extremely friendly and helpful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Expensive but good Since years I stay at the Westin Hotel when in Tokyo.

great styling Great styled hotel. got a good deal on the internet for the room with breakfast. Breakfast  restaurant were good. Prices at bar were high (800ml of water 拢5!).Door closers are a bit fierce and there were regular lod bangs from doors closing (didn't stop us sleeping though)!.Very close to Tower Hill Tube and easy to get into the city centre.

Great Views, Great Hotel I had the pleasure of staying here for a few days and must say that this is one of the better hotels in the country. I was in room 3905 which had a great view of the golden gate bridge in the background. Staff can't do enough for you, they always call you by name. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant Silks, but everything else in the hotel is top notch. They had a good rate of $395 a night for a room which normally sells for $610 a night.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
lub is great! We stayed here for 3 nights in club and although the rooms are on the small side and showers lack any real power it was Jean and Joyce,the concierge, that made our stay here more than comfortable. They arranged everything from reservations in the best restaurant in the South West (Binkley's) to a hot air balloon ride over the desert, they just could not do enough! The Club lounge is exactly as a lounge should be, full of great food and masses of free drinks all through the day and more information about the area than you can shake a library at. Would highly reccommend, but only in club.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

11 days in HK We stayed at the South Pacific Hotel from 07/03/2006-16/03/2006 and found our stay to be most enjoyable. The hotel is quite basic,with a bar fridge and kettle,very clean and well located in Wanchai,with shops (two good bakeries nearby) and Times Square an easy walk, transport is very close. The concierge, the doorman and the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive. The twin bed room was more spacious than the double room, the beds are easy enough to push together. We would have no hesitation in returning to this budget hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
wonderful benefits I was thrilled when I called Seattle Pacific Hotel and was given a fantastic weekly rate. During my stay all personnel were always responsive to my needs. I had a very late flight out of Seattle the day I left, and I was allowed to stay longer in my room with no extra charge. All the people at the hotel were very accommodating. I will definitely stay there again. Lucy Wrigh####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Good Hotel Above standard 5 * hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful and eventhough they were very very busy they managed to check us in early!! The rooms are standard, but the bathrooms are exceptionally big and nice.

Mother's Day weekend Considering the price of $65/night (Priceline) it was a great stay. We had 3 rooms, all with 2 beds, at this rate and it's our 3rd year in a row winning this hotel. We use the parking lot just outside the hotel for overnight parking ($10/night), love the coffee shop for a quick snack or breakfast and haven't had issues w/the staff, service or anything.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Everything was perfect The Duquesne was a perfect place for us. The view was spectacular, rooms comfortable/clean, breakfast (complete with eggs, ham, cereals and assorted pastries) more than expected. The front desk was kind and helpful, especially for a lost suitcase. This trip was for my daughter's sixteenth birthday and she loved it.

Superb breakfast view Ok, I'm a little biased because Berlin in the snow in mid-February is inspiring, but this was a superbly located hotel, with great facilities and very helpful staff (whose English is far better than mein Deutsche). My girlfriend pointed out that were it slightly further up the Ku'damm, by only about 75 metres, it would be more expensive to reflect the slight-change in area, so it really is a bargain. I've never been in a hotel where for such little outlay you have a MASSIVE bath in a marble bathroom, set in a large, well laid-out clean and comfortable room. My top tips would be to have the (very ample buffet) breakfast there, whilst enjoying the view from the 6th floor -fruhstuck even runs until 10, so you can still have a bit of a lie-in; and to get a City/ Welcome card, as the hotel is very close to stations for all the forms of transport (except trams, being located in the West), thereby utilising its much raved about location. We would eagerly use it again.####[['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Fantastic Kapok - loved it! We loved the Kapok so much we stayed there 3 times over a 3 week period while coming and going from Beijing!

We'll definitely go back.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Just awful I wasn't able to sleep at this hotel. The door between rooms was not sound-proofed, and TV in the adjoining room was turned up all the way. Though I called the front desk twice about it, they were unable to hear the TV from the hallway and therefore didn't do anything about it. I would not recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Multiple Great Stays For the 3rd time in recent months stayed at the Sheraton Metro Center, off Dunlap Ave and the Black Canyon Freeway (I-17 N). Received upgraded status on 2nd and 3rd stays in addition to the normal Gold Member service that have come to expect from Sheraton Hotels. Great service, very friendly staff and they serve an excellant complementary full American style breakfast. Easy access to the Metro Center Mall as well as easy via I-17 to Phoenix Sly Harbor Airport. Will definitely stay again when in Phoenix area.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Fine but pricey stayed here for a long weekend - nice hotel and obviously can't beat the location - we were in the castle club which is worth the extra money as had 'character breakfasts' every morning - that way you can gets lots of photos and avoid eating in the hotel for lunch and dinner - had the buffet at the Inventions restaurant one night which was awful - go up to the Disney Village if you want to eat something decent for half the price - there is a planet hollywood and a few other acceptable chains in the village - good standard of room but OD'd on the air freshner - very comfy beds - staff were fine - kids loved the weekend though which is the whole point - still considering the cost could make a better effort to feed the grown ups####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Silly Style Over Substance I spent two nights at the W recently and had to supress myself from laughing on several occasions. The pool has the letters WET printed on the bottom - thanks, I would never have guessed... This place has pseudo-hip styling flourishes that serve no purpose and dance music is piped into every conceivable public area ( gym, elevators,lobby,restrooms, etc.). As you approach the main entrance, large motorized drapes automatically part and reveal - a staff of slacker twentysomethings ! Overall, those over age 26 may want to look elsewhere.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Superb location and wonderful room We stayed in room 609 at Swissotel from 9th to 11th August to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The location is superb right by Dam square with many great bars and restuarants only a short walk. It only took about 15 mins to walk from central station.

Ideal hotel We really liked this hotel, we were originally booked for the Kempinsky but due to a mix up we couldn't get in, and booked this very much last minute. The hotel is a little tired however they are working on that and it will be rectified, the breakfast was wonderful with lots of choice. All in all we would definitely stay here again. If you are going to Berlin for a few days and know how to ride a pushbike we would strongly recommend the fat tire bike company, nothing too strenuous, but a great way of seeing the city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Highly recommend this quiet 2 star No more doubt as to where to spend a night or two in Paris. This two-star hotel is above average, well kept, well organised, honest and forthright. The hotel team was quick and eager to help with any projects: my wife and I felt we were a respected part of things, and Paris became accessible and comprehensible for us. We recommend the Hotel Monte Carlo.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Elegant serene I went back a second time this summer because I loved this small, chic and most restful of hotels.

There are better choices I stayed at the Shinjuku Washington, hoping to save a bit of money on a trip to Tokyo. The hotel lobby was in a chaotic state and the staff were not particularly helpful or courteous. My room was clean, but truly tiny and in need of refurbishment. I had to pay extra to leave my luggage for a couple hours after check-out. I would prefer spending more for a nicer hotel, such as the Century Southern Tower in the same area or the Mercure Ginza.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Average..!!!! Good value for money, very clean and OK breakfast. The position is excellent and only a stones throw from central station.

Highly recommend the Berchielli We spent 2 nights at the Berchielli last week, and the experience was completely delightful: perfect location (on the river, an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio); friendly, attentive staff; spotless, attractive rooms; and an excellent (hot) American breakfast. Other family members had spectacular river views through 2 huge windows in their rooms. My single room, which I referred to as the princess room, since you went up 2 flights of stairs to enter the sleeping/bath area after you came in the door, had no view, but was so delightfully quiet that I happily accepted the trade-off. The size of the hotel was perfect, with a boutique atmosphere. I loved Florence, and will hope to have the opportunity to return and enjoy the Berchielli again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
firmed reservation, but no room available when we arrived I reserved two rooms several months in advance and confirmed them via email one week before arrival. Nonetheless, we were apologetically told by the staff that they had overbooked and had no rooms available and were transferring us to its sister hotel Colon. Unfortunately, the Colon Hotel rooms turned out to be run down, with stained upholstery, linens, and carpeting, no air conditioning, and an old, lumpy bed. We found a new hotel. I never saw the rooms at the Regencia, so I can't comment on them (the lobby was simple but clean), but the experience was disappointing and stressful as we scrambled to find an acceptable hotel.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]

Mixed review We celebrated my husband's 60th birthday and I had booked 4 rooms. We had problems with the final billing for 3 of those bills. I received an internet rate of $64 a night, but the bill indicated $127 and we were charged for a valet service that we did not have for one room. Check your billing statement. Also, the rooms were very small and our view was the room of the building next store, but for $64 I can't complain. On the other hand, great location and the staff are very nice.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Easter in San Francisco We had a very nice clean room with plenty of towels for our family of four. We did not use the restaurant, but found many places within walking distance for all meals. The wharf area has plenty of eateries and things to see. This Sheraton is not a resort - so we didn't expect to dine, swim, or exercise while visiting. This is a clean safe place to stay while visiting a major US city.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Too expensive, but clean and big room The hotel is situated right next to Dam sqare, in a quiet area. Location is more than perfect, walking distance to the main attractions (red light d, shopping, dam, bejighoff, central station, flower market, rembrandt, picasso).Don't expect the nice treats of a 180eur/night hotel. however, the room was quite large (around 18sqm) with a large bathroom, very clean.####[['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Highly Recommended We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location and found this to be the perfect choice. Although it is not especially plush the Moore Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
lean/affordable/bit older decor All the staff of this hotel were most accommodatingand very friendly. Hotel has alot of charater and the rooms were clean. However, they were a bit on the older side and could use some updating. The location is fantastic for the theatre districtand dining options. Also convenience stores andbakeries are close by.

xcellent hotel and city Just come back from Beijing, stayed 7 nights at the Crown Plaza, this is an excellent hotel, good location, spotless rooms, great service especially in the champagne bar! booked on the hotel website and payed 拢400 for the room for a week, an excellent price for this level of hotel. a few tips, make sure you get a metre taxi from the airport, and that the metre is used (we had no problems with this) cost to wangfujing street should be 90/110 yuan about 拢7.00, and takes about 40 mins. taxi to the great wall 600 yuan, that includes waiting for as long as you like we were their about 3 hrs, recommend the wall at Mutianyu, takes about 1.5 hours to get to. Great resturant is buffalo at Houhai lake, you will have a great time in this fab city!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

All-Round Excellence We stayed at the Embassy Suites Reforma during January 2008, and we loved it. It had a very convenient central location on the beautiful tree-lined Paseo de la Reforma.

Excellent Hotel - great location Excellent location, right next to Gran Via Metro station and within walking distance of many of the tourist attractionsWe had a nice room with a balcony, which enabled us to see all the way down the Gran Via. The free mini-bar was a bonus and the free glass of cava in reception was also a nice touch. Breakfast had many options and the staff were pleasant and courteous throughout.

Very centrally located We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and were very pleased with our choice. The hotel was less than a 5-minute walk from the Shinjuku Station and close to everything (shops, restaurants, etc). Although the rooms were a bit tiny as are all Tokyo hotel rooms I was told, they were very clean. The lobby was nicely designed with modern decor; very stylish and chic.

Rude people at the QT Bartender in the hotel was a jerk and used strong language towards my wife and I. After complaining to the manager, she made us feel like it was our fault for requesting a drink around midnight. Don't call the hotel for rates, shop through Hotels or something similar for best rates. Another couple traveling with us got a cheaper rate by doing so, and the manager would not match their rate. OK location, 1/2 a block from time squ. Not sure if I would ever stay there again.

Diamond in the Ruff The chancelor is ideally located, seconds away from Union Square, and you can catch the trolley to take you to the trains/MUNI or just walk it, its just blocks away.

Great anniversary night! We were able to check in early (probably as it was a slow day - the Saturday of a three day weekend) and the desk clerk, when entering our Hilton rewards card number, found out it was our 32nd anniversary. She upgraded us to a fabulour corner room, facing the harbor and gave us complimentary access to the executive suite hospitality room. The staff were all very nice, from the bell man who gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do once we got there, to the desk clerk, to the health club attendant, to the shuttle bus drivers. Would stay there again in a heart beat! Was only sad it was a one night stand at the end of our vacation!####[['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

However, on checking in, they told us our room was in another building across the road, which turned out to be another hotel but owned by Hotel Victoria 4.

The hotel is very handily placed for London Bridge mainline and tube and for the attractions of the southbank (Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre and Borough Market) all in easy walking distance, although it would be a good base for any visit to London.

perfect for romantic getaway This is such a cool hotel, very noirish, rat pack, 50's, space-age swingin' batchelor pad kind of vibe, with funky and artsy overtones.

Check out the Bishop Arts district which isn't too far away.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]
Loved it! The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful property located close to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City. It's located a floor or two above a large shopping center (handy as there are banks, drugstores and quick/cheap places to eat). We stayed on the club level which meant check in was in our room (nice touch), we had a separate concierge (albeit not speaking english as well as those in the lobby) and a delicious free breakfast and afternoon drinks.

Location wise, the hotel has plenty of cafes and restuarants nearby as well as some excellent patisseries. It's between two metro stops and one metro stop down from the Gare de Nord, so for getting around public transport / in and out of Paris it was ideal.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

>No Internet access in hotel rooms !! The hotel itself is of average quality but there is no Internet access of any type in hotel rooms! The staff could be somewhat more polite and helpful (at least in opinion of someone used to European standards). If you use the shower be aware that you may get burned as the valve system is obsolete and not well maintained. The hotel is located very close to the airport, but not so easy to find as there are no road signs indicating proper direction and the hotel name is not visible from main roads.####[['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

Such elegance! I loved The Kimberly! It's small, as hotels go, but I never felt claustrophobic in it and especially not in my room. The parlor was comfortable, the kitchen surprisingly complete, and the bedroom was QUITE spacious with an awesome bed.

I would definitely stay here again, but word to the wise: make sure you get your car out of the garage within a 24 hour time period or they will charge you for an extra day, even if you're only a minute or two late!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Seriously lacking This particular Four Seasons property was absolutely forgettable. From the moment we pulled up, the service was way below expectation....sitting in the car with the luggage for several minutes (no bellhop) and having to re-circle the property to get help with the bags, to the missed wake-up call, to waiting for 45 minutes for a coctail server to approach our table in the lounge... everything seemed to be a bit off.

Prescott - A lifesaver THe Prescott came to my aid after I left another hotel around the block which could n't provide high speed access. They set me up with a wireless bridge which worked perfectly with my laptop. I had no problem with cell phone reception in my room and probaly made 50 calls at the time. THe only reason I didn't give this lovely hotel excellent is due to the limited room service.

Avoid like the Plague Have traveled to Amsterdam over 10 times and never stayed in anywhere so TERRIBLE. The rooms were tiny (2 beds in 1 room and 3 in another). The bed was for someone aged 5 or under and the views of a concrete wall were awful.

Fantastic place for the price For the second time in the span of about four weeks I'll be visiting London on business. And for the second time I booked my hotel stay at the Parkcity. As others have mentioned, the hotel is situated at a clean and relatively quiet location in Kensington. It's within a short walking distance from Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum. The staff are friendly and a pleasure to chat. I was suitably impressed with my previous stay at the Parkcity and will be so again in early July.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Perfect stay I have used the Holiday-Inn Miami-Airport West few times and every stay was perfect. Clean and new rooms, quiet, nice staff and near to the airport. Some people here write about a disco / restaurant and loud music from the 9th floor, the Holiday-Inn Miami Airport West do not have a disco and 9 floors, only 6 floors and a restaurant on the ground floor!!All the people with this bad disco and loud music experience have not stayed at the HI-Miami Airport WEST Hotel, this peoples have stayed at the HI-Miami-INTERNATIONAL Airport Hotel!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Budget This hotel is a typical budget down town Amsterdam hotel. In other words, its not for you if you are looking for something nice and cosy. It's for you who are looking for cheaper great location, walking distance to the centrum and Amsterdam Centraal station. It's not to clean and rooms are small, typical down town European. I stay there because of price and location only and only when I'm alone, would not offer it for family.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'neutral']]

Good value for New York Stayed for 6 nights from the 9th January. Had to wait till 4pm for room(official check in time 3pm)The offer of a complimentary drink or pot of tea would have been nice but not offered. Room was big by NY standards and best view over NY I've had in 6 stays in the city. Very central for all attractions and the staff helpful and efficient. Very surprised nobody has mentioned the Westway diner on 9th Avenue between 41st and 42nd street as a great place for breakfast-or for that matter any meal-they're open 24/7.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great find I stayed here on my final day in Sydney prior to a long haul flight back home. Really nice hotel, with great facilities if needed. Also perfect location for access to shops in the cbd as right in the heart of the shopping area, and only a couple of minutes walk to the bars and restaurants at the harbour. Recommended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Good hotel It is a good, clean, high end hotel in Beijing. Although I won't rate it as highly as it is hyped. Even service and concierage is not as great.

Its walking distance from Wangfujing and subway station which is a big plus.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Functional downtown hotel Stayed for 2 nights in July 06, a functional hotel located slightly away from downtown but within 10 minutes walk of most of the sights. I'd have this down as a 3 star rather than 2.5.Received a warm welcome on arrival, and we were able to check-in despite arriving early, lots of information offered by the reception staff and secure underground parking (for $16 per day).Room was clean but not huge. The receptionist advised that the hotel was going to be refurbished later in the year, but it had cable TV, air con and everything else you need when your planning to spend most of your time exploring a fantastic city like Seattle. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on the first day but it was over-priced and the food wasn't great. On the second day we chose to go to one of the many local coffee shops, which was much better and cheaper!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]

w favorite hotel in theatre district I found this hotel perfect for my needs--good area, large enough room, clean, friendly staff, not ridiculously expensive. I even had a view--which is not often the case in less expensive New York Hotels. I booked an Executive double double and it was nicely renovated, and felt fresh. Perfect for going to plays, taking the subway , and finding good resturants close by.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Great hotel Fantastic hotel as you will have seen from the other reviews. Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed and the duck by the bath. Very central for business travellers and there is an MTR station below the hotel in Pacific Place, a massive shopping centre but not cheap!The only slightly negative thing I could say about the hotel is to do with the swimming pool location. The hotel is next to the Shangri-la hotel and in the afternoon the Shangri-la blocks the sun from the pool. Other than that the place is faultless.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'negative']]
Fabulous hotel!! Service - view - location - pool! The Adlon is rated as one of the top 5 hotels in Europe, and with good reason! The site is gorgeous, incredibly convenient to historical sites, and has an amazing view of the recently refurbished Brandenburg Gate. The rooms are tremendous, service is outstanding, and the pool is a decadent Greco-Roman paradise in the middle of Berlin!

Efficient and well run OK it will not win prizes for personality but the rooms are a good size in a great location with comfortable beds - what more do you need?A few tips breakfast is very expensive but if your happy to pay 22 euro each its a good spread but I would advise you to try some of the nearby cafes more BerlinI upgraded to one of the suites it was only a small addition to the price but well worth it and dont be put off by courtyard view rooms they are fine .####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

Will not stay here again! While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham, WA to San Diego, CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Seattle Quality Inn  Suites. Yes, the hotel was within walking distance of the Space Needle. However, when I requested a 2pm check-out (we did not check-in until after 7pm) as per the special services extended to Choice Privileges members, I was told the latest we could check-out was 1pm; the room was small; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed; only one elevator worked and it was slow; the complimentary in room coffee service was provide only for one person; after showering, the bathtub took forever to drain (over 8 minutes) and left behind scum; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room; the business center computer was out of order; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Fantastic hotel We can't praise this hotel enough! Well located in the Mitte (former East Berlin) district, close to U-Bahn and tram lines.

Excellent Apartments The apartments and overall facilities exceeded our expectations. For a very reasonable price we got a new, well appointed apartment that was quiet, secure and extremely clean.

Good value hotel Very good value - we got a deal on Expedia and were pleasantly suprised by the hotel. It was very clean and comfortable and very centrally based in the main shopping district. The main tourist attractions are based in the Mitte; however these are easily reached by the U-Bahn or by the S Line from the nearby Zoo Bahnhoff. Good amenities and nightlife nearby and I would be happy to stay here again the next time I go to Berli####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

Great place to stay Stopped for three days on the way to NZ, and enjoyed immensely. Room pretty good although can get a bit noisy outside, saying that my 5 year old slept perfectly. The reason for 5 is partly for location but mainly for the excellent staff, for example we arrived and I had lost the suitcase keys. the desk guy managed to find a saw and had freed up our possesions before I returned with (superb) coffees from opposite 7-11. Nothing seems to be too much trouble. Will certainly stay again on next trip over to NZ####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
super time, gorgeous place put simply, I loved this place. It was a nice little hideaway on a great shopping street. It was so pretty and quiet, the staff always smiling and happy to help. I must have called them for rides 10 times while I was there and it was never a problem. I also loved their pumpkin soup and lime juice. I hope to go back again, this time for my honeymoon.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Superb hotel, great staff, fab location Just returned from a 3 night stay in Barcelona with my mum. Booked this hotel after reading good reviews on this website and it did not disappoint. The location is fantastic, lots of great sights within walking distance and no matter where we wanted to go, it cost us less than 5 euro's in a taxi. The staff were very friendly and took time to point us in the right direction for the sights we wanted to visit and also recommended and booked restaurants for us free of charge. Our room was very comfortable, they remembered to not give me feather pillows and the free minibar was a lovely touch.

Great Location! For those who've never been to San Francisco, The Tuscan Inn (near Fisherman's Wharf) is the perfect first. We were near all the transportation modes (and there are plenty), shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Our room was large and comfortable, and the staff was top-notch (especially Elmer). If you have a question, they have the answer or will get it for you.

Rude and disorganized staff Arrived from a very long flight with my husband and 3 yr old toddler. The initial receptionist was very pleasant and checked us in without any problems as everything was in order with the room number already printed on the reservation slip at the front desk. After settling in and resting for about 2 hrs, we received a shock of our lives when someone tried to open the front door of our apartment but failed then we got a call from the front desk. The Manager (some guy) had the gull to ask us to move out to another room as the room is meant reserved for someone else and said the earlier staff that checked us in was new. So what if old or new staff, this is not the way to treat guests and not even an apology was given for their mistake! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great location, fun district and nearby a major subway/train station We usually stay at the Peninsula when in Tokyo for business, but a Japanese colleague recommened the Cerulean. The location was great, walking distance to the side-streets of Shibuya and the Shibuya train station which has connections to many of the major tourist sights. The hotel itself was adequate and clean. Service was good, but still not compable to five star hotels like the Peninsula or Four Seasons. A friend mentioned the Italian restaurant there was good, but we didn't have the chance to try it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Unfair Due to loss of my credit card on holiday, I could not show the card used for payment of the room.

The room we stayed in was larger than we expected and was extremely clean and comfortable. As other people have stated, the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy walking distance to other livelier areas of the city. It is also a short walk to the nearest metro station.

A great hotel! This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service, and it is within walking distance of most attractions (we timed our selves strolling to the Duomo and it took about 6 minutes). I know that many times the star ratings on travel websites do not have any basis in realiity, however, this time I completely agree with the rating on Expedia.com that it is four star hotel. The rooms were great, the breakfasts were very nice, and I loved that the shower products are from the famed nuns at the Perfumia Santa Maria Novella. We stayed in Florence for a week and had a wonderful time.

The hotel was fantastic, from the absolutely wonderful rooms to the service, and the great European feel. The staff was helpful, friendly and the meeting staff was available non-stop.

>Caveat on 'Ocean View' Room We booked an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower. There was a nice view of the harbor, but the only way you could actually see the ocean from our room would be to step out onto the balcony and lean over to see a small sliver of Pacific. I complained that this did not constitute an ocean view in my mind, but the hotel staff told me that is how the room is classified, and refused to move us. Other then this disappointment, the hotel was great.####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Great hotel in a very convenient location I really enjoyed my stay at the Abba Sants hotel. It is very comfortable, modern hotel. It's location, a few minutes walk from the Sants train station, is very convenient for travelers who are visiting the city. The hotel staff was great about giving restaurant recommendations that locals actually go to. The only downside was that the rooms were uncomfortably warm and the only way to cool down was to open the window which unfortunately let in the noise from a very busy street.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Good Value and Location Spent 3 nights ($110 per night) at the Ilima in Dec 2005. Very happy with the proximity to Waikiki Beach and the surrounding designer boutiques (Gucci, Chanel, Prada, etc.) and restaurants. This is not a 4 or 5 star establishment, but that is OK, since you are not paying prime $$$. The rooms are outdated, but clean, comfortable, and roomy. We found the staff to be friendly. If you are looking to save money and be within walking distance to all the action on Waikiki, then stay at the Ilima.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Very comfortable and clean hotel with a great breakfast buffet We arrived direct from the airport and recieved excellent service from the very start. The twin room we had was very spacious and had a very useful small kitchenette, with microwave, dishwasher and small stoveThe breakfast buffet was very busy with a long que, but worth the wait and had a good selection. Location is good, with many of the Boston tours stopping just outside. USS Constallation is within walking distanceI would stay at this hotel agai####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great Place to Destress..... Just returned from 3 nights at the Maya Ubud which was absolute heaven. We stayed in the superior garden villa - and the only sound to be heard was the birds and the occasional thwack of a tennis ball. The Spa is situated in a great location and the elevator ride down to reach the infinity pool and facilities is a great way to avoid the steps! We both had the 75 minute massages and it was so tranquil to only hear the sound of the river flowing below and the odd frog!The amenities around the hotel were excellent and we ate in most of the restaurants and found the service and food to be fantastic. We also did the nature walk with a guide and enjoyed going through the villages and walking through a rice paddy. All in all a great place to stay if you want to have peace and quiet but be close to main centre (5/8 minutes away)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Perfect location This is a great little hotel in the most romantic spot right on the canal. Yes, difficult to find on first arriving, but that's the only thing I'd say to watch out for. The location was perfect, right in the centre of things but not so close that noise is a problem. The room was lovely and so were the staff. I think this is great value for money.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
A comfortable stay My wife and I stayed here when we were up for a Red Sox game. Our stay was very nice and everything in the hotel is excellent quality.

A hidden gem in the center of Manhattan We love small European hotels and rarely see anything similar in the United States. We could have sworn we were in Paris but we were in the middle of New York.

Shabby is definitely the word Checked into the Sheraton and asked specifically for a room NOT overlooking the construction. Got a room overlooking just that. Ripped curtains, dirty carpet (from construction dust). This property is not run by Sheraton, just under their umbrella. For the price charged, I would NOT recommend staying there. Perhaps Sheraton should review some of the hotels they license to outside owners.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Disappointing Given the reviews I read about the Oberoi and the reputation of the chain, I expected excellent and consistent service. We were surprised at the lack of consistency of the service and had a bad experience with the staff's confusion regarding whether breakfast was included in our rate. The management is clearly not doing its job in ensuring consistency and communication amongst the staff. The grounds, however, are beautiful and the location is lovely, however I think there are better value for money options in Bali.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
ral location with friendly atmosphere. We stayed here early October and even though we had done our homework on location, were pleasantly pleased with the hotels location. In the heart of the city, just a few steps away from Chinatown and easy access to the two cable car lines or street cars, to give you quick tranportation to the main attraction areas. Ok there is street noise but then again you are in the centre of a city and the lift can be heard but not enough to disturb you. Our room was on the ninth floor and the view from the window overlooking the roof tops was lovely, the bathroom was very modern, and it was handy to have a safe deposit box in you room at no extra charge. We found the hotel recepitionists all to be very helpful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Not what I expected unfortunately. After booking in for business travel I was given a small rooom with barely enough space to walk around the queen size bed. Not very luxurious with regular TV etc (no flat sceen), and no view from the 6th floor. I requested a better room and was given a room on the top floor right next to the elevators, which were noisy and disturbed my sleep. After requesting a room change again I was given another average room by front desk staff who seem reluctant to help. As far as deluxe hotels go this place is really quite average - I think there are many better 5* hotels out there.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great value Hard to imagine better value for the money. The room was clean, the location great, the staff courteous (although sometimes a bit flustered). If you want great value, stay here. If you want a hotel where the staff grovel at your feet and lick your boots, then stay somewhere else and pay much more. A note for critics of the staff ...a few thoughtful words in French will pay substantial dividends in terms of service.####[['service general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Recommended Hotel In Hong Kong Nice hotel on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong (I typically prefer Hong Kong Island side as its closer to my favorite shopping areas and cool neighborhoods like SoHo). I'm definitely a fan of the Shangri-La chain of hotels. The service is always fantastic and you get a feel for the Asian culture. The rooms are very nice, spacious, and well decorated. The lodging was very reasonable when I stayed there - around $200USD/night - more than worth it!####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Loved it! The hotel is in a up and coming area of Berlin, where people are on the go 24/7 - its great for nightlife. The staff were friendly and provided an excellent service.

Good Hotel My husband and I stayed at Plaza Lucchesi Hotel for 2 nights while in Florence. It was a good hotel but the location was a bit out of the way, it's not in the heart of the city and you either have to walk a bit or take a taxi to get anywhere. But its right on the river and restaurant is very good!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
Best hotel in Amsterdam This hotel is a personal favourite of mine. An Amsterdam townhouse on a quiet side canal, yet within walking distance of just about anything you want to see (and convenient for Anne Frank's house in particular). The rooms are HUGE, well appointed, with clean bathrooms, fridge, TV, buffet breakfast and friendly staff. It's the only place I would stay in Amsterdam. Try for a room on the canal side.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
ice hotel We had a beautiful room, very big, with a comfortable bed and a huge bathroom, But this is an old hotel, dated. I found it not very clean, the carpets were dirty and also the restaurant was like that (and food was not so good...). I didn't like all that cement, gray walls. Anyway, people working there were nice, we arrived late at night but they allowed us to have dinner even if the restaurant was already closed, and they gave us a lot of information: very nice and polite. I think it is a good hotel if you have children (the pool is very big), but it is too much expensive for the quality of the building.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

Recommend this Hotel Have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and we would highly recommend it. The rooms are fine and spotless, the breakfast is great but what really makes the hotel is their fantastic staff who are friendly and willing to give good recommedations for restarants etc. The location is also good, very central and we had 3 rooms in different parts of the hotel and none of us suffered from any of the noise referred to in earlier reviews. - despite us being 40ish year old women.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

A well run hotel with pleasant helpful staff, a lot of whom have worked at the hotel for many years - always the sign of a good hotel.

Wonderful Visited for 3 days in March 2006 for our sons 21st birthday, What a great City and an even greater hotel !! We looked on Trip Advisor prior to going and the Savoy was highly recommended, we were not disappointed. Situated in the Plazza Della Republica with great views this is a beautiful hotel with great rooms great restaurants and some of the best trained staff we have ever come across, the service was second to none and the manager should be proud of him/herself. The location is great with all the attractions of Florence within easy walking distance. Our rooms were at the front directly overlooking the Plzza Della Republica, it was amazing , we could look out and listen to music playing every night, from violins, to salsa, opera and the atmosphere was electric - Cant wait to go back !!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Ok, room in HKG are very small but this seems too small, otherwise concierge service was good and location is ok for Kowloon nad Nathan Road.considering all and what i have paied I can say this hotel is on everage quality and I will return only If I could be able to find a very... very... good price... otherwise not!!!####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['hotel quality', 'neutral']]
better for pleasure than business As lovely as other kimptons in terms of quality of finish  amenities. Very servicable fitness area, in-room desks with wired net, cute nautical touches. Right smack in the heart of the tourist waterfront. I would come back with my spouse for vacation or if you're a business person dragging family then this would be a great fit. Some of the rooms are quite spacious and would be good for families. As a straight business traveler it was a distracting location, with a low noise level that I'd roll with if I were vacationing too but was hard to not feel curmudgeonly when I had 7:30 am meetings.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]

recommended by a friend We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008. A friend had recommended the Queen based on a stay from several years before. Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia. We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there.

Above average, good value Spent 2 nights at the Eastgate Tower, in mid-town Manhattan. It is well located, close enough to Grand Central Station to catch the trains, a healthy but do-able walk to Broadway Theatres, and there's a decent bagel place (Daniel's) a couple of blocks away. The room (2 beds) was large, with a kitchenette, which is very convenient for storing and heating up food (there's an oven/range+ microwave, sink and fridge, with dishes and utensils provided).

Overall good For the price and location you can't do better. The staff is very friendly, you are 30 seconds away from the beach on foot, and 30 seconds away from buses to the airport or old San Juan. Isla Verde (where the hotel is) is a safe touristy place but, of course, old San Juan is far more picturesque -- and far more expensive... Make sure to eat at PLATOS, the hotel's restaurant: some of the best food I had in Puerto Rico and, again, very reasonably priced.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Spot On Not one to write these types of reviews generally but would liketo leave a few comments on the Hotel D'Albe ( Rue De La Harpe ) as accommodation in city centres can often be hit and miss. Went with my wife and my parents for short break via Eurostar to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday and can only say experience was superb. Staff were very helpful with all travel ,restaurant and river cruise bookings - as said location ideal,premises were very clean and would definitely recommend to any friends/family in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Nice place for limited budget My experience with this place was very positive. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The location is excellent, close to several major tourist spots and close to public transportation (5-10 mins walk to underground stations and a bus stop (24) right in front of the hotel). For anyone who does not want to spend a fortune staying in London, I strongly recommend this place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great find in a beautiful city Stayed at this gem of a place over the christmas weekend and really enjoyed it. The location was very good, in the Southern Canal Belt which was close enough to all the major attractions without feeling too touristy, and the tram links were frequent and convenient. After reading the previous reviews was actually prepared for a small closet room but the bedroom was pleasantly spacious and definitely one of the bigger ones I've seen in Europe. The complimentary minibar was a nice finishing touch, and the Living Room reception area, with a cheery fire and free flow of drinks and snacks, was a lifesaver for those cold Amsterdam afternoons.. All in all, a great place and would not hesitate in recommending to any####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Magnificent Oasis of peace in the middle of the bustle of Mongkok. Superb hotel with all the expected facilities at a good value price. Our 25th floor Executive Room was spacious, clean  comfortable. Excellent service throughout. We have never had as stress free an arrival in a new city as we did in Hong Kong, having booked the transfer from the airport to the hotel. Good location close to subway, making easy connections to all parts of the city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great Location Great location, would recommend this hotel for a city break! Just off the Placa Catalunya, but no problems with street noise, the room was fine. A little small, but we didnt spend much time there anyway. We didnt eat in the restaurant and breakfast wasnt included so cant comment! Would go back.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Great Position and Value for Money We stayed at the Plaza Mayor in November 2006 during our Around the World trip. The staff were absolutely fabulous and so helpful. They recommended places to eat, especially La Bola,and advised us how to get around Madrid. The room we stayed in was fabulous and had everything we needed. We would certainly return to this Gem of a Hotel.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Four star location, one star service The palomar is an elegant hotel with a good central downtown location. The restaurant is rated highly by a number of gourment magazines and rooms are pleasant if on the small side. However the front desk staff have no interest in helping customers outside of routine check in and check out. Service is more akin to a 1 star hotel. I would rate the hotel 4 stars for location and 1 star for servic####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Great stay at the Palomar Stayed here for five nights, excellent food and service. A meal in the resaurant is a must and the breakfasts are good, but expensive. Lovely quiet room at the back, no view to speak of but didn't need it as the hotels central location means that more time is spent outside the room than inside! Could not fault this hotel, a perfect place to start a holiday in California.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Decent, comfortable rooms Provides decent accomodation. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel with helpful staff, this most certainly is not the place. However, the rooms are clean and the parking is free. For a Boston hotel, the price is economical. The neighborhood is in transition, but I still would not wander around after dark.####[['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Seattle's Best! Arrived very late in the evening for a one night stay. Staff were very solicitous, and on par with the hotel's service standards, each request was met with of course. All staff were pleasant, rooms were comfortably furnished with the latest innovations in guest room design, baths were wonderful. Even for a one night stay, this property was the best I've experienced in Seattle. Special kudos to the Pan Pacific for staff training; this is the best formal service I've received in a long time!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]
Problems with Website I have not stayed at the hotel, but did make an online reservation through the hotel's official website. This has proven impossible to cancel online. The hotels cancellation web-page is non-responsive and my hotel-issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box. I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer's comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e-mailed his cancellation. Obviously this hotel has problems.####[['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great value, huge rooms This property isn't the nicest or the best location, but the rooms are huge and clean. I stay here for business a lot and can really spread out, like having an apartment while I'm away from home. The staff isn't the best, but friendly and accomodating. If you are going to the convention center, this is one block away. If you're leisure traveling, there are other great places to stay in the same rate level with more character, but for extended trips it can't be beat for the price and comfort.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'neutral'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Nice little hotel in the middle of the big apple It a small hotel on the Manhattan side of the brooklyn bridge that is good for a business or pleasure traveler. Standard Hampton morning breakfast, helpful staff, but very small rooms, so if you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it might be cramped. Walking distance to most lower manhattan toruist sites, and the deli around the corner is very good. Nothing fancy, just gets the job done.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
a true oasis I stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and previously wrote a review based on that stay, saying i thought the value vs. price was not worth it, that it was overpriced for the caliber of hotel it was purporting to be, but I TOTALLY retract my negative comments. i just stayed there again on my last visit to London and couldn't have stayed at a finer hotel. the price is very comparable to other luxury hotels in London and what you actually get in return is tremendous, beginning from the warm welcome by the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff, to the welcome glass of champagne and array of snacks, to the invitation to join them for canap茅s and drinks in the evening and the turndown service with candles, robes and slippers laid out. it's a true oasis from the rush of central London. you won't regret it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
The Silla is fabulous and so reasonable Brilliant, quiet, family run, view over Arno, 5 mins walk from ponte vecchio - ask for room 23 or equivalent - aircond is whisper quiet but enough to mask traffic and partner's snoring. Recent refurbish is good though ensuite is small - who cares the shower works well. Lovely terrace for breakfast or drinks - minibar in room will take your duty free, but no tea making equipment (only minus point). Can't wait to get back.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Treat in Amsterdam I stayed at the Piet Hein with my boyfriend for 2 nights in March based on the user reviews posted on Trip Advisor and wasn't disappointed. This area of Amsterdam is great as it's out of the main hustle and bustle, near the museums and close enough to be able to hop on a tram and be in the heart of the action. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful and the place was clean as were the rooms - nice white linen and a bright, clean, modern bathroom. The hotel is also located right next to Vondel Park, great for strolling around and watching the locals run, jog and walk their dogs (sometimes at the same time!).I would definately go back here when next visiting Amsterdam.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Wonderful exterior but damp  The Fullerton is in a fantastic location - especially if you are doing business in Singapore. And it looks great from the outside. But the rooms can be very damp and musty - and I've stayed in this hotel on about 8 separate occasions now.... Plus worst of all is that sometimes in the middle of the night I've been woken up by extremely loud airconditioning noises. Not acceptable in a 5 star hotelIf in Singapore and looking for a decent hotel I'd recommend 4 Seasons or Raffles The Plaza as better hotels for similar or lower price.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
>A perfect beginning A fantastic location providing excellent value for money. For 拢50 a night in central san francisco this hotel is certainly a find. The continental breakfast is a good start to the day including waffles, breakfast croisants, cereal, toast and huge muffins. The hotel is two minutes from union square and close to both Powell Mason  Hyde and California cable car lines. My only criticism is that the rooms are a little small and you can find yourself falling over your bags.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Great hotel! I really enjoyed my stay at the Barcelo Hotel Sants. I spent a week there and if you're looking for moderatly priced accommodation in an excellent location, i would thoroughly recommend you stay here. Location, service, rooms were all excellent. I have to say that i did find the breakfast fairly expensive (approx 11 euro), although you do get a discount rate if staying in the hotel.

Great location! Great location base from which to explore Amsterdam. Basic amenities, but that was all we needed for a City break. Rooms were clean and serviced, breakfast was provided and there was plenty to fill up on. For the price we paid it was a great value for money and the reception staff were very helpful in answering questions, booking taxis etc. The only grumble was that there was a lot of noise in the night due to other guests coming back late!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Quality hotel at reasonable prices - recommended I stayed in the hotel on the first weekend in February with friends who were celebrating a wedding. Found the hootel to be spotlessly clean, convenient for the underground and most of the sites, the staff were very friendly and all spoke good English. I only ate there at breakfast, but this was excellent with lots of choice and good serving times. The bar was lively in the evening and the barmen were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The receptionists also helped to locate traditional German food and everyone enjoyed the hospitality of our hosts. It was my first visit to Berlin, but I will definitely be going again and will stay at the Movenpick.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Very bad place We stayed at the hotel in two days from the 12of dec. to the 14of dec. 2008. The hotel are run down, the room are smelly and dirty, and the staff are not very helpfully at all. Eating breakfast at the hotel is expencive and you are still hungry after, because of the very small portions. We where gratefull that we only had to spent two days there, before going to Miami port for a seven days cruise with the beautifull ship Freedom of the Seas. Never again the Marseilles Hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

Great little hotel I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona and this hotel was great for my stay. The location is amazing, literally 2 minutes walk from La Rambla, a lot of people say this area is dodgy but as long as you don't walk around on your own it's fine and I never felt under threat going out for dinner at night, just try to stick to the busier roads rather than the small alleys. The hotel was extremely basic but clean which is the most important thing. We had a well equipped bathroom, a TV and a mini bar apart from tea making faciliites there was nothing more we needed. The staff are very helpful too. If you're looking for a budget hotel in Barcelona then this is a great option.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Hotel De Gerstekorrel I stayed at the Hotel De Gerstekorrel on February 2006. Decent accomodations. Nothing fancy, nothing too shabby. Rooms were a little small with small beds and a small bathroom.

Fairytale trip to the sky. What is not to like. We checked prices at several top rated hotels and this was the best deal for the money.

Good, with a couple of minuses Many plus points distinguish this hotel - nice setting, friendly and cooperative staff, comfortable rooms.

Worst Hotel Stay... Ever!! We stayed here for the weekend to celebrate a bachelorette party. When we got to our room the door was wide open, our room key didn't work so we had to reactivate it every time we wanted to get back in, the floors were dirty, we didn't have enough beds to accodomate the girls, our window was broken with 90 degree hot air seeping in, no curtains to shade the room, and our bathroom light was broken! The hotel staff was rude and don't believe the pictures they show on their website, it looks nothing like that.

Fantastic Bang For the Buck I found the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour to be a bargain compared to other hotels in Sydney. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Factor in the friendly staff and good location with a very reasonable price and you have a smart selection for the budget traveller (but not too budget!).Lots of tourist sites, a plethora of restaurants and shopping areas within walking distance from this hotel.

An enjoyable hotel I stayed here recently while attending activites at UCLA. The hotel was well-managed and charming with a clean, soft-modern feel.

The beach is supurb (Like the bounty advert) lovely warm sea,very safe to wonder around,plenty of sun loungers,and parasoles for shade,the food is very good plenty of choice, breezes is a very clean and kept clean hotel the staff are very pleasent and very helpful,We would recommend taking a box of PG tips and a couple of bars of Cadburys and any other required pleasures, that can't be bought out there,you will be ripped off buying things in the hotel. The country side is very plush and green breath taking scenery and well worth taking an excursion out and experiencing the local culture.

very pleasant stay Stayed here from 8th April for 3 nights and had a very enjoyable stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The ooms were nice if a tad smaller than we are used to and the absence of a bath was a disappointment having said that the were nicely decorated with modern furnishings and a flat screen TV.The hotel is in a quiet location about 15 minutes walk to the Placa Catalunya or 2 minutes to the Rocaforte Metro stop (and then 5 minutes on the L3 line to the Pl. Catalunya)We did find the breakfast room a bit of a crush but the food was adequate and frequently replenished.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
look no further Wonderfull place to stay. Especially for romnantic weekends. All the other reviews are right; super atmosphere, high ceilings, delicious breakfast and small-scale charm.

Wonderful Resort/Concierge The resort is wonderful, but the staff is exceptional. I would like to personally thank Concierge Kary and Carolina in working patiently with us in trying to locate our lost luggage (airlines fault). Their professionalism and kindness helped keep our stress to a minimum. To their credit, they had to help several guests who experienced the same situation and they always had a smile for each guest.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5, 2005. It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10:20 p.m. on the night of Saturday 2nd. It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night. I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me. I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night. Luckily the security latch was on the door and the intruder could not enter.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here over New Year for 3 nights and it is one of the best hotels we have stopped in. The service and attention to detail is amazing. If you get the chance, book an executive room as this gives you access to the exec lounge where there is a complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails and canapes in the evening. It was worth every penny!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Not your average hotel room I've stayed at this hotel twice, the first time with a group of girls for our friend's bachelorette party. The location was great, the staff was fine (though, admittedly, we were not that demanding of them), and the suite was huge. Also, we like the '50s/'60s-era feel and the fact that we weren't in another cookie-cutter chain. The location is also wonderful. I look forward to my next trip back to the Magic Castle.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us. It was great to be able to walk off the Ramblas straight into the hotel, where peace and tranquillity was the order. The staff were both courteous and efficient and the bar service was excellent. Some may consider the rooms on the small side, but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair, you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer. I have recommended the hotel to both family and friends and will definately stay here again on our next visit.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict']]

Perfect Madrid Accommodation My friend and I stayed at Cruz Sol in July after having made an internet booking months in advance. When our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hostal at 2am, we were welcomed in and shown to our room which was exactly as stated on their website. The rooms were clean and secure with extra conveniences such as a hair dryer, safe, patio and a decent sized bathroom. Very central location with fabulous bars and restaurants nearby.

average at best This hotel has a good location, but not a lot else, it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room, including giving us the key to an occupied room, and keys that did not work. We were then allegedly upgraded, from what I cannot imagine, the room was tiny, and not air conditioned. The continental breakfast was a complete farce, a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom, which had then to be carried back to the bedroom, where there was no where to eat but on the bed. The staff apart from the initial difficulties were pleasant and helpfull, and the hotel seemed clean.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Disappointing and watch the final bill I've stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated (given the price) I've returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it. I wouldn't return to The Clift; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge/front door staff are all good but that's about it. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen (and I had a loft suite) - and for the price other hotels offer more (no flat screen TV, ineffective air con). What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US$185 for late checkout without any notification (I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11.00am). E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
OVERBOOKING Problem I did not stay at this hotel, I had just booked a room with a booking site. When I arrived to the hotel, 2 hours later, they told me that they had no free rooms since the day before. They helped me to find another hotel for the night ( many hotels were full that night) but Idon't think I will book again this hotel for my next stays in Barcellona.####[['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
More than adequate for its class We stayed in the Monna Lisa for 4 nights in early December and had a positive experience. This is not a luxury hotel, but given the price we had no complaints. The street is a quiet one and the location, near the Duomo and on the same street as La Giostra Restaurant is very convenient. Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with, graciously providing information and making reservations for us for dinners and tours. The breakfast was very good and the dining room cheerful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

an't wait to return to UMA Stayed at the UMA for 2 nights in a terrace room and emerged totally relaxed and recharged. Was lucky to catch the hotel in low season, place was utterly serene and prob only saw a handful of other guests around the entire time. Restaurant, poolbar and front desk staff were friendly and helpful. What I really appreciated:5mins walk from Mozaic (must be the best restaurant in Bali)Pool is a good length could be 25metresFree transfers to town from morning to nightResort is lush and green with lots of plants  flowersComo shambhala toiletriesNo major issues with the hotel except that there were flies by the poolside, which makes it inconvenient if you want to leave your food /drink unguarded while you take a dip.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative']]
Terrible elevator... The room was fine as well as the location of the hotel (not too far from city centre). However, there were 2 big problems disappointing me: noise on the outside and a constant beeping from the elevator door throughout the night whenever the door opened.

Excellent accomodations. Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace. It is a lovely hotel deserving of it's 5 star rating. The employees were very helpful, very accomodating. Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money, asking about areas we wanted to visit, ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants, even getting a massage. This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]
Be very aware of the location This is a lovely restored hotel on Market Street in San Fancisco. The problem is that it's the wrong end of Market Street.

Best Service at any Four Seasons Having stayed in many Four Seasons Hotels (married in one) this location is tops in service!

Excellent AB Viladomat Having just spent four nights at the hotel AB Viladomat I can highly recomend it as a clean good value and very pleasant place to spend a few days. The staff were all very friendly and helpful I would have great difficulty in faulting the hotel at all, it is a little way away from the city centre but the public transport is so simple to use that it is not a problem. The main tourist spots are within a twenty minute walk. I would certainly use the AB Viladomat if I were to travel to Barcelona again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]
Great location and friendly hotel I chose this hotel mainly due to location as I was taking my Mum who can't walk so far - but it was a great choice alround. We were upgraded to one of the new apartments which was great and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is very good and the light snacks in the roof bar are excellent - plus the open terrace is a great location to sit and have a glass of wine and admire the view. Very good location and close to some very good restaurants.

Clean Room / Great Location / Excellent Price I was entirely satisfied with my stay at the Prince Conti. I was shocked to find a safe and clean room at a price as low as the Prince Conti's midweek rates. While the hotel may lack some of the amenities of the 5-star New Orleans hotels, it is still an ideal place to catch your breath before heading back out to the Quarter or the Faubourg Marigny.

bad first impression The Operator who picks up the phone at the general number gave me the wrong fax number. Then when I called back to inquire, the second person was very curt in correcting me, not only was there no apology, she hung up on me as I was still talking without even a 'good bye'. This kind of service attitude is simply not acceptable anywhere, let alone a hotel of this level. If you are going to compete with the rest at this category, make sure your first interface with clients is not this rude and short sighted.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september. Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF, we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel. It presents itself as a cute boutique hotel which is how it looks on the website, however the reality is not. Room was tiny, deco was average, cleaning was it is minimum levels.

Not more than ok Spent 3 nights at this motel early July. Rooms ok, clean but rather small and without a wardrobe to hang clothes. We were travelling for a month and had 3 suitcases for which we hardly found space in the room. Fridge and micro stuffed into the room, no place to eat except in bed. Similar to another review, we also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude from the owners, demanding our credit card for security even if the stay was prepaid through Expedia, and it was also not the place for asking questions. Location ok, a bit far down on Lombard Street but as Norwegians we're used to walking.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great hotel Just got back from a 4 night stay at this hotel, which I thoroughly recommend. The room was lovely, really big and with added extras such as free aveda toiletries, a well-stocked mini bar and a pillow menu, so you can choose the pillow that suits you and your needs best! And the club room on the 2nd floor is well worth taking advantage of, with big comfy leather sofas, a huge TV and free tea, coffee and water at all times and best of all - free wine and cheese Monday-Thursday between 6pm and 7pm! The staff were also great, really friendly and helpful. The location is good, between third and Lex with a subway station within a block and Grand Central a short walk away, and it is within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants all down second and third avenues.

agree with "do not stay here" This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn't give it two. A hint to future guests: if you have a problem, it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations. They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it. They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns.

Great hotel, but not so great location The hotel is very modern, with an air of trendiness, the furniture is new and very nice, the bathroom is large, well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny. On the other hand, some things are a little kitchy, like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room (first I thought it's parquet), the breakfast is really poor, the parking a little too expensive (15 euros a day) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying. The hotel is near the train station, but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room. Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls. It takes about 15 minutes to the center.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Great Hotel, no Monkey Bar This is a wonderful hotel that is similar to many classy European hotels. The room (76) was elegant and clean, and the location was perfect.

great stay at the Sumner + good location to all the main sights, newly renovated, clean/comfortable/efficient great wireless internet, breakfast was ok, staff was very good/friendly/helpful, overall excellent value for the money in London = we chose the Sumner mostly based on Tripadvisor feedback ... the feedback was bang-on! We had a really good experience at the Sumner and will definitely return, I may even consider staying here on business for my next trip to Lond####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Brilliant Hotel Thanks for the great ideas I got from your site - we had a brilliant holiday in the U.S. I've travelled extensively over the past 35 years and lived in 6 countries - the Omni in Frisco is my new favourite hotel- it was worth every penny - they got the little things so right and were charming and helpful hosts - the room was spotless and well appointed and the location is good. Really - I was so impressed I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else ( and it's not just for oldies my teenage daughter was also impressed)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Excellent all the way around We always stay at Embassy Suites when we can and this one keeps with the tradition and quality that you come to expect. The concierge and all of the staff were always friendly and helpful. We tried to upgrade to a full ocean view and couldn't but the partial view was still wonderful. You can never miss at Embassy with the full made to order breakfast and daily managers reception. Highly reccomend and was excellent all around.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Great hotel The R-C BP is not as high profile as some other NYC hotels. However, it is peaceful, beautiful and a lovely place to stay. The rooms are spacious and the service is great. The location is great for business travelers, but a bit out of the way for exploring the city. However, the hotel is a great value, especially next to comparable hotels in midtown.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Loved the Hotel de Varenne This was a wonderful and cute hotel with great staff. The rooms were immaculate, the breakfast was great and the little courtyard so nice. Location was quiet, close to Embassys, federal buildings but also Museum Rodin and Hotel De Invalides were around the corner from the Hotel as well as the Metro. I would recommend this hotel anyday.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Renovated rooms are great! I checked in at midnight on New Year's Eve as part of a layover and desk staff was great. After reading bad reviews here, I asked for a renovated room which was very impressive!

Band kids were not well controlled, resturant service bad Husband, dtr, and I stayed here in order to get flight out next morning. Hotel room as expected for Embassy Suites, Noise level on bedroom side from road very loud and disturbing. H.S. band in hotel for Fiesta Bowl were still running wild at 11pm.

small small small This is a hotel where you can stay if you never have been to the city before and plan on getting up and going from morning till night. If not, don't attempt it. Dont get me wrong the decor was nice and the hotel was clean but you have to walk sideways between the walls and the bed. We ended up leaving and going to the Crown Plaza where I know the rooms are nice sized.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'conflict'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Very good choice Excellent location : close to every touristic spot and surrounded by restaurants and bars. Of course a bit noisy at night as this is the busy area to go out.

Loved the Castle Inn! We stayed at the Castle Inn last week, on our first visit to San Francisco. We loved it! It was better than we expected for the money; nice, big room, tiles and heat lamp in the bathroom, great location, very clean, and the helpful man at the front desk told us where to go and where not to go. I did call ahead to ensure a non-smoking room, after reading one of the other reviews. I hope we can return someday!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

very nice airport hotel Was very pleased with this hotel. Rooms are very large, well appoingted but with plenty of space for luggage etc. Breakfast was more than adequate, with made-to-order omelets, and the whole facility was immaculate and actually worked! Only negatives we noted were shuttle service from LAX is on request which we didn't know and lost some time waiting curbside before calling, and if you rent a car or drive, note that hotel parking is $15.00 per nite. Since it is very close to the airport the aircraft noise might bother light sleepers/children.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Wonderful hotel The staff of this hotel was so helpful and nice, it really set our stay out on the right foot.

Fantastic Hotel Hotel Johann is a really great hotel - the breakfast is fantastic, the rooms are clean and modern and a great size with fab bathrooms. It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin (its very cheap, efficient and easy to navigate) but the area was no problem - I guess it's worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are. I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price, venue and facilities (breakfast, spa, small bar, minibar, bikes available and outside seating). Stay here!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Sufficient I wouldn't necessarily go back to the Hostal R. Capitol, as I found it a bit old and crumbly for my taste, but it has a couple of redeeming qualities: First, it is located right on the Ramblas, and there's hardly a more perfect location for those who enjoy bustling activity in their immediate environs. Second, I was extremely grateful that I was able to book the room shortly before 10:30 on a Friday night, arrive about an hour later ... and check out around 5:30 the following morning. The helpful gentleman at the front desk, on duty all night long, was undaunted by the unusual (but, in my case, necessary) hours. In short, this would not be my first choice for Barcelona accomodations, but if you need an inexpensive room in a pinch, Hostal R. Capitol suffices.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Lovely hotel in convenient location This hotel is conveniently located to the train station and all the key sites. We walked every where. The hotel and breakfast room were lovely.

A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $34 dollars a day. I may have been ok with this had I known, but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website. The manager was quick to show me where the charge was buried in the website rather than to come to some agreement since this was a suprise. Be careful when staying here..... there is a charge for just about everything including to use the gym.####[['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
kimberley A-OK We stayed at the Kimberley Hotel at the last week of April. The room was clean,the bed linens crisp and the bathroom spotless. For the price we paid,this was a great deal!It's location was near to 7-11,and shopping galore along Nathan Rd, Cameron and Granville St.. Just near the hotel is a money exchange dealer who gave us a good deal for our U.S. dollars. The MTR stations were just a block away.all in all i would recomment this place to all.the room is rather small but for its price and strategic location, i can overlook that aspect.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
Not what we expected We were to stay at the Riu Palace Macao for five nights, we stayed one. The facilities were old and mold was a definite problem for us.

Great value The rooms are pretty old, but clean. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from union square and market street.

Great Customer Service... Stayed for two nights and was placed into the wrong room type on the first night due to 'overbooking'. This was not a bother as I was by myself for the first night.

Loved the Marriott Marquis I was a bit unsure about this location due to the possibility of noise. We had a room on the 30th floor. It was very quiet and we have no complaints.

Q We booked a four-night airfare/hotel package with Expedia,choosing the QC because of the mostly positive reviewson TripAdvisor.com, which turned out to be accurate. TheQ C will not knock your socks off, but it covers the basicbases handily: with a pleasant, clean room and a few pleasing extras like Bath and Body Works toiletries, a second magnifying mirror in the bathroom, etc. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. One drawback: we were put in the second building next door on Camp Street, and the room had permanently-sealed windows of frosted, pebbled glass -- gave kind of a claustrophobic effect.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]

Very average indeed The room was large and comfortable, but I was not otherwise terribly impressed with this place.

Recommended, but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online. I'm sure this hotel is fine for vacationers: the rooms are ok (especially the kitchenettes), the location is pretty good, and the staff are helpful. However, I don't recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer. The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm, and the wireless internet mostly non-existent (at least while I was staying). It just isn't worth it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative']]

Very good I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews on here - unless parts of the hotel are still being renovated. I stayed in the tower part which was very good - air conditioning was excellent which in Singapore is a must. The rooms are quite small (the bathroom especially), but otherwise a decent place to stay for a few days. There was a regular free bus into town, and it's only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay (about 30 mins to Orchard Road).Happily stay again, although as ever I do resent having to pay extra for the internet when you pay a fair whack for the room in the first place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Nice location on clarke quay Hotel rooms were clean. Was given a room that could accommodate 2 adults and 3 children which was 2 double beds and a rollaway which was great.

Great for our short break Nice place at a really decent price for proper Hong Kong hotel (we booked through a thai website, great deal).

Total incompetence The staff at this hotel all of the way up the manager are totally, totally incompetent, definitely stay away! My initial reservation was totally botched by someone who sounded like a teenager answering the phones. Then when I called to cancel my reservation I discovered that the mistake had never been fixed. Even worse yet, despite cancelling, my credit card was still billed and after 6 calls and several e-mails to the hotel, including Leah the manager I was never responded to!! I have never never had an experience like this at any hotel in my life!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Nice and simple This hotel had everything we needed. We only stayed one night but the price was right and the staff was helpful.

Great hotel for a city break We stayed at the Residence Inn from 6-10 June 2008 for 4 nights. We had a 2 bed suite on the 14th floor which had everything you need even had large dishwasher and a huge fridge/freezer which came in handy for ice cream as there was an heatwave on whilst we were there. Could not fault it at all. Hotel is in a great location, plenty of resturants nearby , not too far to the train station. I think this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when doing a city break. Would definately recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam. We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer. The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden, which was perfectly nice and quiet. Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East, for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional, something you don't see everywhere. Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well (which we didnt join since we had other plans).Staff, especially porters and concierge, were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans, which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay. All in all, the location can't be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff, Pulitzer gets a thumb up!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

really disappointed I can not believe this hotel has such rating stay away from it, I think it deserve one star the most. The service is really bad and not to mention things disappear from your room and their respond is we are investigating it, they charge you for compelementry coffee, and it takes them five hours to get you a taxi to the air port. Bottom line very expensive for the service for the same money you can get a real 5 star hotel. Trust me stay away.

Lovely hotel I wanted a great hotel in Amsterdam with a pool for a leisure stay. The Amstel was the most fantastic place to stay; cost an arm and a leg but worth it if you can afford it. Great room, food, service, nothing at all to complain about.

vercharged at check out! The hotel room was fine, rather small but ok. What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate. Of course at check out, they upped my rate even after I reminded them and they assured that I was getting the the lower rate but charged my credit card more. I traveled throughout Europe and this was the only hotel that charged me a higher rate.

Beautiful accomodations We stayed at The Legacy in September 2006 and found the accomodations to be very clean and beautifully decorated. There were two TV sets with DVD players, a kitchen, jacuzzi tub, dining room area, etc. The workout room was very well-equipped with up to date machines and TVs. Would definitely return!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
we loved this hotel I stayed at estherea with my husband and my daughter (who was 9 mths old at that time) in december 2005. i write this review only now because I want to recommend this beautiful hotel which we loved very much. We had a lovely canal view room at the last floor, very romantic. Really tremendous view!Wonderful location, in the very centre of amsterdam. Staff not particularly friendly. Very nice hotel anyway!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
great stay We spent one night at this hotel after reading several reviews that were not so good. Worried about the hotel and the neighborhood after a car break in comment, I am happy to say that our stay was wonderful, the surrounding area around the hotel was nice, and the whole stay was great. We have nothing bad to say about this hotel. We frequently stay at holiday inns and this was a nice one.####[['hotel general', 'positive']]
Good location but now looking dated Stayed at the Blacket for 7 nights from the 28.12.06, we were charged a huge supplement for New Year and were annoyed to find the hotel restaurant was closed, the only choice for breakfast was an over priced continental breakfastLeaking ceiling took 4 days to fixLocation is great, room was large but very drab. The hotel was probally cool a few years ago but is now looking old and tired. Staff are helpful but no room service or help with your bags. Overall Ok but if you are loooking for a spacious room in a central location.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
Decent balance of cost/location/quality The location is great. The rooms are motel like, but sport great views of the city, especially at sunset and dawn. Don't expect great service, though it is not the worst. Comfortable, respectable, a good value in LA.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Lovely boutique hotel The Hotel Ares Eiffel was renovated a few months ago and has been done very tastefully. Some of the previous reviewer photos are a bit old and not at all representative of the current state. The room we stayed in (executive) was very nice. It's reasonably expensive but bearing in mind the location and that this is Paris, probably about right. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a very nice boutique hotel!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great location My husband and i have just spent three nights in this hotel. It is ideally situated to see all the main sights as it is right across the street from the train station and under ground, which I must say we found to be brilliant as they all seem to arrive on time. The hotel and the rooms are very clean. The staff are friendly and the concierge are excellent for information about the best way to get to sights. All in all an excellent trip and I would have no hesitation on recommending this hotel.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great Experience I went to New Orleans with my new Fiance and we stayed at the Doubletree on Canal street and had a great time. The location was awesome, and the hotel was very nice and clean. When we checked in there was a large convention in town and we got upgraded to the Junior Suite which was just incredible, the staff was friendly and professional. I really enjoyed my stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great NYC Bargain! Great hotel - reasonable price, good location, and very clean room. I travel a lot for business and would definitely recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers. Bed was very comfortable, room was quiet and had all the necessary conveniences including free high speed Internet access. Great bar across the street and a short walk to Times Square. Check in and check out were quick and efficient.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
great value - in der mitte just returned from a two night stay at the mercure - a very unpromising facade, but don't let that put you off! We payed around 70 euro a night - and i was pleasently surprised. We had an enormous room, big comfy kingsize bed and a great shower. Couldn't ask for anymore really, about a 20 minute stroll to mitte and hackescher markt. A good value base in Berlin.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved the Copley!! We recently stayed at the Copley for a wedding. The event itself was beyond belief; everything was perfect and the staff could not have been more attentive. The room was small but spotless with a beautiful bathroom and a delightfully comfy bed. Great location; right around the corner from Newburry Street shopping.

Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel. When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip, we got a cancellation number. A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Over rated We just came back from a 3 night stay at this hotel. The room ( # 6 ) is very small and obviously the web site photos are very unrealistic. Furthermore facing the street and canal you are assured of sleepless nights from all the party goers at nearby Rembrandtplein. We stayed at hotel Pita 2 years ago and although not as central as Seven bridges at least we were able to sleep at night.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict']]

loved this hotel loved this classy hotel. lovely lobby, beautiful rooms, pleasant staff. Didn't eat here but located short stroll from upmarket outdoor mall with nice restaurants/cafe. Valet parking good service but pricey. When returned to UK appeared to have been charged the wrong amount to our credit card - tried to sort out by email but are insisting we write to them if we want a copy of our account -not hugely convenient when you live on the other side of the world. hope to get this sorted out as appear to have been significantly overcharged and if we can't sort it would not stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Great Little Inn This great little inn proved to be in a perfect location. Not only was it two blocks from the beach, it was convenient to Santa Monica and LA.

great hotel loved this hotel. centrally located, great price, nice size room, quiet, great shutters that shut out all the light so you can siesta during the day. only minor complaint is that the temperature of the water varies when you shower. i think if someone on the floor above you flushes the toilet or something the water temp in the shower first gets really hot then cold before it returns to the temp I had set. really minor complaint though. this hotel was great.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
>Exactly what we pictured Florence would be! What a beautifully appointed hotel; really a classic! We had an adjoining suite which was absolutely phenomenal, overlooking the Arno.

Good Hotel is at good location to shops and foods. The hotel staff were fantastic, friendly, informative and helpful all the time. The room is very cosy but not very big, anyway that is the normal size of hotel in Hong Kong.

My favorite hotel in Paris Having trawled many websites looking for the perfect hotel for our silver wedding anniversary celebrations we happened upon Duquesne Eiffel Paris. We booked a Superior room for 5 nights and had a fantastic stay. Lucie was very helpful and the room was spotless 鈥?they were just renovated. We enjoyed the balcony and, an added bonus, the subway station was just near the hotel so travelling in Paris was amazingly. Altogether great accommodation in a wonderful location.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great Hotel ,perfect location I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni and really if you want an excellent hotel in a great location this has to be your choice. The rooms are of a good size with large bathrooms and a walk in shower, i had a premier room which was an upgrade from a deluxe room which i paid for ,to recieve this uprade sign up to Omni Hotels signature program and you will recieve this for free as well as other benefits such as late check out. As all the other reviews state the staff are excellent, i travelled with my 2 year old daughter and all the staff made a fuss of her. As far as location goes to me this is in the best location in the city union square shopping is 10 mins walk in one direction and fishermans walf 20 mins in the other and north beach and chinatown on your doorstep, although there are plenty of buses ,cable cars and taxis if you want to take it easy. I booked with hotel connect a uk website which were 拢400 cheaper on my booking than any other website. Room service is expensive but breakfast in you room is nice, go on treat yourself ,your on holiday.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Nikko - Clean and convenient. I stayed at the Nikko for 2 days prior to a cruise from San Francisco to Alaska. When I had to change dates at the last minute due to plane problems, the hotel was extremely accommodating. The staff was very helpful and always cheerful during my stay. The hotel is only a block from several great restaurants and a three block walk from Union Square and all the shopping you could want. The price is a bit steep, but the clean and comfortable room with a 42 HDTV made up for it.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Loved the valentine special offerings I normally do not stay in Dutch hotels as my job puts me up in enough hotels abroad. However my boyfriend treated me to a valentine weekend in Amsterdam. I was impressed, a lovely room looking over the Prinsengracht. Special touches, even rose petals sprinkled over the bed after our dinner. A lavish dinner and a good breakfast the following morning. Simply a superb stay in a lovely hotel in a city I had forgotten had so much to offer!####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Not at all what is used to be This once was a nice hotel which has gone for the cheapercrowd, tatoo people, Mom Dad 3 kids in a room type deal + events. Way too small to handle both conferences and wedding events on the same day along with family outings. This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences, cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd, and weddings anyday of the week which means: bottom line the facilities are not available 24/7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard. What was once a $400 night hotel for the business, elite traveler is now a $49-79night cheap 4 star; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline, this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed. Very crowded, very low class. We had business guests with written reservations well in advance, two were bumped out of the hotel; we were treated rudely, pulled our corporate account.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont. We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite, we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money, the rooms are huge. We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river. I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had, however, on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill. A lovely hotel in a great location and if we visit New York again we would not hesitate to stay here.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Nice hotel, uninteresting location This hotel itself and the staff are very adequate but being located in downtown Miami is a hinderance. It is far from the beaches and its pool and health facilities are very small, considering it is in Florida. The surrounding area is undergoing a great deal of building and renovation so currently it is noisy; I am sure it will improve in the next few years. Overall a good hotel for business meetings but not for vacationers.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Good for Marathoners Stayed here for the Marathon weekend, like they said it's not a great neighbourhood but you can't beat the price, parking is free, and the complimentary breakfast is what you need. The free shuttle bus worked well most of the time, we used it to get to the subway. They even made sure it was good to go for us marathon morning.

Great for our family of 5 Great hotel for family! We spent four nights at the Ilikai with our 3 sons, ages 15, 12 and 8.

They won us over We weren't sure about this hotel at first - it needs a bit of TLC and a lick of paint in some areas, but the staff made it for us. We didn't see one rude member of staff - all were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is extremely well located and being on the fourth floor we didn't hear any noise at all - even though Barcelona had just won the league and the streets were alive with cheering mobs of football fans when we arrived! I would definately stay here again.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
unbelievably unhelpgul!! I am staying at Spaulding at the moment. We only have a few days so we wanted to quickly arrange some trips - but the extremely unfriendly receptionist has flatly refused to help us, or even let us use the phone to call the tour companies. We have no phone, the internet is too slow, so we're now setting off to macy's third floor to find a payphone.

Great Petit Hotel, Superb location! Very nice hotel, in the very center of florence, the street on which it resides is the street that goes from the duomo to the ponte vecchio, right in the middle of those 2 attractions and just 1 block away form the piazza de la republicca.

Great Base for City Visit Stayed at The Prescott for two nights. The location near Union Square is extremely convenient for shopping around the Square and in the excellent Westfield Centre, the cable cars along Powell towards Fisherman's Wharf and Muni along Market towards Embarcadero.

The room was not large but the furnishings, bedding and bathroom were all of a high standard.

Not so bad... I went with the expectations of a horrible experience because of the reviews, but it wasn't so bad...

Tiny room with many ants The room wasn't available to check-in until late afternoon. Once in the tiny room we discovered it was full of ants.

Having no other rooms we checked-out and were not charged.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative']]
A Very Special Place I had done a lot of research into hotels in Venice and with the help of the reviews on tripadvisor I booked my girlfriend and I into the Hotel Al Ponte. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and can honestly say that it was one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The rooms were extremely clean and very comfortable. The hosts we helpful and attentive at all times without being pushy!!!The location of this hotel is brilliant, close to everything yet far enough away to enjoy a walk through the streets of Venice to the main sights.

Stayed at the Kimberly June 24-27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr, 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6. They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable, pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location, nice doormen, and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we'd stay again -####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

ideal location excellent location, not knowing the city, we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area, pier 39 , the deals, alcatraz. The hotel was very plush inside, staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile. Our room was fantatic, modern clean and decorated to a very high standard. The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn't get to appreciate the facilities. Would suggest this hotel used if time to be spent relaxing within the hotel, if a hotel needed to use as a base for sightseeing then maybe this one is a little too expensive.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]

Awful hotel I spent one night only, fortunately, in this hotel. Upon arrival we had to pay cash before entering the room, theN we found on one bed , dirty linen that had to be changed. The room lacked maintenance on the furniture and in the bathrrom nothing was repared. In the morning breakfast was very poor and when i asked forchocolate for my child they did not have any. And to finish we asked to leave the luggage for the day and it was kept outside in a courtyard getting wet because of the rain.

Small Rooms but great location We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The price was great for the location. The room was very small but very clean. The bed was really comforatable. Breakfast was a little disappointing, not much variety and you had to pay for coffee!!!####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative']]
A great base to explore SF Stayed here for 3 days while exploring SF for the first time - what a great place! Very central to Union Square and transport links, I was very pleased with my find as we were so central!Good bed in average sized room, very large bathroom, breakfast supplied in lobby in the morning is the average American continental danish and coffee. Can really recommend this place if you are keen to be central and want to spend your time looking at the sites rather than trecking back to a hotel on the other side of the city####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
uld be better Just got back from a week in Seattle and loved almost every minute of it. The Pacific Plaza, while a good buy, could use some improvement. We were on the top (8th floor) and all the heat in the builidng seemed to rise into our room. Also, while the room was non-smoking, the internal ventilation system seemed to draw in smoke from other rooms. The staff was very courteous and helpful, and the location is very good.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
1 x star Stayed at the American Hotel at the start of April 2006, will NEVER go back! This hotel is advertised as five star!! I would give it one star. DO NOT GET A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR!!Room smelt of damp, rubbish bed, crap decor, badly in need of complete overhaul from ceiling to floor. After complaining I got moved to a 'two star' room, We are going back to Amsterdam but not to this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Good location,Quite, Clean, and Great price We spent 4 night at Grant hotel, a very good choice for us for the first time visit San Francisco. The hotel is located just right in down, Union Square, Cable car are just in a block away. China town only 2 blocks distance. Our 4 nights stay at Grant hotel based on all our expected.

#4 Hotel in Los Angeles??? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights. Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms. Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like. The carpeting was stained, there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub. Granted the location is good, however if I knew that the rooms looked like this I would have gone to the Roosevelt.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Just Perfect!!! This hotel was more than expected!!! In the center, close to the bigest shops and to La Rambla, with very helpful staff, we booked the romatic package through their website and we had the breakfast included (very good) and a bottle of cava for free!If you like the modern decoration, you will love it. The standard room is not so big, but if you store your clothes in the closet and put your suitcases under the bed, you really feel like home!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'neutral']]
really liked it We stayed in December just for 1 night, but I liked the location, the room (great bed) and the staff. The restaurant was very good. It is joined by the skyway to 2 rather pricey malls, but is was good not to have to go outside to shop. Legal Seafood is in the mall, Yummy! I would stay again in the summer as it is not far from Fenway and lots to see walking around.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
One of the finest hotels in the world This may be the best hotel we have ever stayed in. We stayed in the Executive House Zen which is very pricey, but well worth it if you like unbelievable service. The rooms are modern and roomy by Japanese standards. This is a standout for business travelers or vacationers for whom the money is not the cheif concern.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
we like the St Francis This is a lovely hotel with a sense ot charm and history. However it is a bit dated in places, (corridors and rooms), however it is really in a great location, right overlooking Union Square, right in the midst of it all, and close to shops, restaurants etc. we were on our honey moon so they gave us a special room which was really quite big and nicely furnished. the champagne mojitos in the bar were pretty excellent too.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
The staff make this hotel truly awesome! We decided to visit the wonderful island of Bali for our Honeymoon in October and after scouring the internet for the best all inclusive resorts there chose to stay at the Melia Benoa hotel. The staff at the hotel were simply superb; Mendrin, Pardi and Augustini were the highlights providing service with a smile 24/7! Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front, with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants. Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options, imported spirits, late check out and free laundry service!Also had a good tour of the island with Wayan - recommended although don't forget to take extra cash to buy souvenirs and to get into the tourist attractions!####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
EXCELLENT!! Stayed on a two night break and it was excellent!Staff very helpful and fluent in English - bar staff also brilliant (thoroughly enjoyed the snacks put out to enjoy with your drinks in the bar downstairs).Rooms were amazing and definately have a 'wow' factor. Staff recommended excellent local restaurants to eat in and found walking to them and the touristy places very easy. I would really recommend this, and have done, to everyone.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Very nice hotel This hotel offers great value for money, the rooms are large for Japan standards  have great views over Akasaka.

fabulous! We arrived at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne with high expectations, which could have really set us up for a disappointment. Fortunately, we were even more impressed than we thought we would be. The staff was very helpful, always smiling, and the room was wonderfully clean, with a distant view of the Sacre Coeur from the balcony (on the fourth floor). It is close to the pyramides metro station, so it's easy to navigate the city from its location. I'm not sure that I will choose a pricier hotel in Paris, because this hotel has so much to offer--all the more reason to splurge on some fantastic French food!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
A Very Good Hotel at a Very Good Price This was a very good surprise in Madrid: The rate was extremely good (90 euros/night, booked about 2 months in advance); included internet, minibar complimentary; was Exceptionally Clean; Recently renovated; Quiet; Well located (short cab ride or walk to Prado in one direction; Mayor Square in the other); very friendly. I was extremely happy with this hotel and would recommend it if you're looking for a smaller hotel that is quiet and well located. Note, it did not have exercise facilities and the on site restaurant was pricey; however, eating options were readily available at a number of restaurants within 1 to 3 minute walk.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]

To Much Attitude and Bad Customer Service I stay at this hotel regularly for business. The attitude from the employees seems to get worse and worse each time.

Good hotel - but watch your wallet This hotel has character and is in an excellent location. The restaurant is very good - reasonable prices, huge menu, very popular. Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned. Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street. Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room. The hotel (and cleaner) were no doubt banking (correctly) that we wouldn't bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

lean and good location but aimed at gay community. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but small. We believe they cater for a gay market, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
zy This hotel may appear old and run down from the outside but I found it quant, clean, and roomy on the inside. I rented a room that had a bathroom. The room had room and even though the building was older it was clean. The was location was great, (2 blocks from Pikes Place).I stayed for 3 nights. My only complaints were thin walls, (you could hear chatter next door even when others were using speaking voices), and one night were the neighbors liked to party late.####[['hotel design_features', 'neutral'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Great Hotel, Great location Travelled with my wife and two friends to New York to see the St Patricks day parade. We found the staff very helpful and pleasant. Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed!!We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great. For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast, be early it gets very busy. The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk. Ps Do the circle line boat tour to see the statue of liberty and the new york skyline it is fantastic.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Would Stay There Again and Again I have been to Amsterdam a half-dozen times in the last few years, and Seven Bridges is where I will stay the next time and the time after that. The location is nearly unbeatable. The view from canal-side rooms is unbeatable. The rooms are charming, spotless and spacious. The price was right. I have paid a lot more for standard Amsterdam charmless fare, but I won't again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years. An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff. Great location in Midtown on the East Side, close to restaurants, shopping and an easy walk, cab or subway ride to museums. Highly recommended especially if you can find a good deal online either through the hotel itself or an online travel agency. My only complaint is the high prices for room service and still a $10 per day charge for high speed internet.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of. Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation, the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel, which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare. We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn't get much satisfaction. I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service. We will not be going back there.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Fastastic Value and convenient to airport. This reasonably priced hotel was the surprize of our trip. The hotel is located less than a block from SEA-TAC an has 24 hour shuttle. Coast appears to have undergone a recent remodel, and the did an excellent job. Located on International Blvd and next to the airport I was surprized to find that neither the street noise nor air-traffic were loud.

Misrepresentation We booked three hotel rooms, w/two double beds. We made our reservations six weeks in advance.

wonderful hotel We stayed for 4 nights at the Argonaut - our second stay here. The hotel's location at the end of Fisherman's Wharf and almost next to Ghirardelli Square is just about perfect for vacationing travelers - very convenient, yet quiet. Service is excellent, beds are extremely comfortable, and rooms are well decorated and clean. The hotel's restaurant, Blue Mermaid, is very good (although we liked Capurro's across the street better for breakfast). The bowls of fruit in the lobby and the wine hour in the afternoon are great added touches that make you feel good that you decided to stay there.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Good Value and Great Location I was looking for a clean and pleasant hotel in a central location and this really fits the bill. The modernisation has ben done thoughtfully with old features retained but clean, spacious modern rooms. The staff were helpful and the hotel was great as a base to explore the city. I did not eat in the hotel - there were too many tempting local restaurants nearby - but the bar was stylish and welcoming.

uld not have been more pleased.... After relying on Trip Advisor (once again) we booked a 4-day stay at Iberville Suites and could not have been more pleased, The location is perfect - 1 block from Bourbon Street and all the action - but the QUIETEST hotel we have ever stayed in! All of the employees we came in contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fine - but of course one day you'll want to go to Cafe Dumond for those amazing beignets. The rooms are very, very clean and it truly is a suite - separate sitting area, 2 TVs, etc. We would most definitely return.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]

The bathroom was fine with a good shower. I did not eat in the restaurant as their is plenty of choice in amsterdam, the bar is expensive but a pleasant enough place to meet up or finnish the night.

pretty standard, good location Me and my wife stayed at Coral Princess Inn on November 2005. The hotel has a very good location and the area is quiet and decent. We are not the type of people to whine about the change of sheets and spots on the walls, but there seemed to be a major problem with their air conditioning at the room we were staying in. We got that little room no 12 for 99 USD per night on the second floor. The temperature in the room was never under 32 degrees celcius and we found it hard to sleep sometimes.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location, that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar, and the rudness of the people at the front desk. Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise, and when you only need five minutes to get to any place, you forget the rudness of the front desk staff. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was ok, and remember this, if is clean and has a great location, the restis not important. Will definitely come back here. They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm, with very good food.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris, I was concerned to choose well. After reading several reviews on the internet, I selected the Hotel D'Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice. The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was 'at the heart' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme, Louvre, Pompidou Centre, Pantheon etc. The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright, clean, and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate. All in all, the Hotel D'Albe surpassed all our expectations, and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit.

Great Hotel Consistent Service, Not a Good Location Have stayed here a few times for business, and this hotel never disappoints. courtyard, pool and spa are an oasis in this concrete jungle. Rooms area clean and consistent and up to four seasons standards. Hotel not located in the best area of the city, and I would not recommend walking outside, even though there is a park closeby. Hotel is located in an area with alot of one way stalled traffic, so a real pain to get in and out of the hotel if you are trying to get to meetings or the airport to catch a flight.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
A nice, affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona, but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price. Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord, you can't stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona's top sights. Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street. Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room, and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early (9:30ish) in the morning. Otherwise, this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great Hotel I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and knowing it score #5 hotel in Toronto and I must say it deserve the high ratings, large rooms with kitchen, free sauna and gym on the top and great location, just 10 min walk to union Station and CN tower. Don't expect to view the skyline as the hotel is not very tall and it's surrounded by offices.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great hotel, great service, great location! My family of four, including two teenage boys stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is excellent, the rooms, although fairly small, were certainly big enough for the four of us and were well maintained and very nicely decorated. We received very good service and would definitely stay there again if we return to Boston. Everyone, including the desk clerk, concierge, door man, and housekeeping staff were friendly as well as helpful. I have no complaints and would highly recommend the Boston Park Plaza.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Fantastic hotel, fantastic city Planned a four week vacation to Australia and found trip advisor to be totally helpful to me, felt like I should share my experience. Hotel is great, great location, really comfortable beds, especially after flight from the UK. Darling Harbour is great for restaurants and bars and hotel is within 2 mins walk. Go to the Blue Mountains in Sydney and use Oz Trails for the trip - superb. Have a great trip.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive']]
Excellent service I stayed at the Radisson as one of a group of 40 that travelled to Boston for the St. Patricks day parade. I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel facillities are really good, including on site swimming pool, rooms are above average size, excellent beds, spotlessly clean, restaurant is well above average and hotel is very centrally located and convienient to airport (12 mins by cab) The reservations dept were extremely helpful throughout and were not in the least fazed by the inevitable changes to bookings that is inherrent in a large group. In short, highly recommended and would definately stay there again when in Boston.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
Still my favourite - but... This is definately my favourite hotel in Paris (considering my budget).Great location, friendly staff, surprising design features, nice rooms, clever lay out, but... we were lucky. Friends travelling with us stayed in the same hotel, at the same rate but didn't really get what we got. They walked into a really tiny and a little run down room, and the bathroom was very tiny and didn't 'feel' clean. So picking this hotel is like playing the lottery. You can get lucky - like we did, or you can be less lucky like our friends.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Big rooms, near the night-life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise. Very well-located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well-decorated. Service is good-enough and the stairs (there's no elevator) can be scary if you have big suitcases. Very good deal, specially for young couples. It can be a little noisy at night due the bars around, but nothing that bothers too much.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

The views are just to die for!!! Stayed here for a long week-end, November 4th - 8th, in Room 308 and the views from that room were marvellous, the Louvre, the Musee D'Orsay and the Eiffel Tower and we overlooked the Tuilleries, these views were even better at night when Paris was lit-up!!! The room was comfortable, fantastic bathroom - huge and the bed was one of the most comfy that I have slept in anywhere in the world and the hotel is in a wonderful location.

New Hotel with nice accomodations I've just stayerd at The Westin hotel in San Francisco wich has a terrible name since it's called Market street and it's located at Third street, but on the other hand it has an excellent location, just 1 block away from all main business and commercial area at downtown SF and at the corner with Four Seasons hotel...

Ideal For Long Weekend First impressions of the hotel were excellent. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff who were keen to ensure that our stay in the hotel and Barcelona was as pleasant as possible. Our room was large, if basic, with a good standard of cleanliness. Due to the tiled floors the noise from corridors did tend to echo in our room however, this was not a particular problem that would put us off returning to the hotel in the future. The location is ideal for the tourist with limited time, very close to the centre but situated away from the noise of the main thoroughfare.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Not a bad pllace to stay We needed a fairly inexpensive place near the Quarter and found the Courtyard. We arrived not knowing what to expect. While it was not luxurious it was clean, the pool/courtyard area were fantastic and easy to get to, and the staff was friendly and bent over backwards to help make our stay enjoyable. No matter where your room is, you are close to street level and traffic could be noisy at night. The continental breakfast was small, but it was available all morning long and the coffee was great! While it's not the Ritz, it's not a bad place to stay.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Wonderful Experience - Excellent Customer Service Stayed for one night this past weekend and got a terrific rate through an online newsletter. In spite of the rate, we were treated like honored guests and upgraded to an incredibly large room since the check-in folks noted that we were travelling with two kids. Requests for foam pillows and a rolloway were answered promptly and my children loved the kids welcome pack at check-in. Truly superior service all around from valet parking to baggage check to front desk. Loved the hotel and location and will definitely stay again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24/7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino, but the rooms themselves are a little tired. That said, they're still well equipped - the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in had everything we needed, except for the absolute lack of patio furniture. Beds were clean and comfy, and the lounge room was roomy. The hotel is starting to show its age though, and the standard prices are several times what they should be. If you want to stay somewhere nice and central (and open around the clock), check out local hotel websites in advance and you should be able to score a room here at half the price or less.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

Newly fitted room, expensive breakfast It鈥檚 a big hotel in the middle of the city. Quite old even if the room and bathroom are newly fitted. Nice selection beauty products and it鈥檚 possible to choose the most comfortable pillow. It鈥檚 quite an anonymous, therefore, if you鈥檙e looking to something with a traditional Dutch atmosphere it鈥檚 not the hotel for you.

Vacationing at the Melia? Think again! The Melia Caribe, being a 5-star hotel, has very poor service and over-rated food. There's not much to do during the day and no night entertainment that is worth watching.

Loved everything about this hotel We were looking for a property near LAX, only 7 minutes away and compared to the LAX airport high rises this was a steal. From the welcoming reception, cookies and apples in the lobby, upscale furniture and the cutest open courtyard with bistro sets this hotel does it right. The decor in the room, fluffy towels, above average bathroom accessories and a fridge, bottled water is everything you need. Great location from the pier and no problems at all with noise.

Absolutely terrible! We stayed here in August 2006 and this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at.

The room held up to our expectations from the photos on the hotel's website, it was beautifully furnished with antiques, expensive carpets and curtains.

Excellent room and service The room was excellent, and the staff very friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. They also arranged a doctor to visit the hotel to see our young daugther, and then also interpreted. My only observation is that you probably don't need to book a canal room as there's not a huge amount to see out of the windows. You'll enjoy the stay####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

I really enjoyed the location, the hotel is great (nice lobby, stylish rooms, good concierge service, etc). The only thing I didn't like (while staying at the 12th floor) is the view - there was none - only a back street.

Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and although we did have some minor troubles (check in delayed by half an hour, water pressure) the staff of the hotel and the manager in particular demonstrated great understanding and excellent customer service. Interiors are very well designed, minimal being the key word. I'd go back there as the location is perfect, we walked everywhere and didn't need to take the tube at all! One highlight: the breakfast! Eating out in Barcelona can be pretty pricey so the huge buffet with savory and sweet choices, cooked brekfast with tortillas, eggs, bacon, etc is definitely worth it!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Once is enough If this is a 5-star hotel, I'm a monkey's uncle! I'll give it 3-stars on a good day. The rooms are dated although ours was good sized and with a nice view over the Dam.

Breakfast was ok - we didn't bother getting up for it after the first morning!There are several good restaurants within walking distance and all the main tourist attractions are close by. An extra benefit of the hotel is that they have free internet access which is great for that lastminute research or online check inIf you're looking for a hotel that is great value for money, then definitely go for this one!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]

Yes, the rooms are as tiny as all the reviews say, but you can't beat the location. And really, how much time do you actually spend in the room. The hotel staff was courteous.

The food is ok but repetitive especially if you are staying for 14 days like we were. Entertainement was poor, nothing really jumped out to us and as an English family our son was bored to death as her had nothing to do, and most of the other guests were none english a lot of spanish, french usa.the beach and pool areas are fantastic no complaints there, like a lot of other people we had upset stomachs and my son was ill in bed on arriving home for 2 days Dont know were the problem lies as we were always careful with what we ate and drank.would be fine for a week but 2 weeks confined in one place is not for m####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
I bit expensive but worth it The hotel is located right in the Ostbahnhof so very good location for getting around the city and out of the city. It is a bit expensive but if you take into consideration that you get a good breakfast included, and free transportation on all the S bahns, U bahns and busses, it is worth it. You just go downstairs and the train station and the S Bahn is just down there. Also a mall with all kinds of restaurants and shops.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest. Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty. Hair in sink and bath was off putting. Best measure of (lack of) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window. We were told someone would clean, then they would clean next day - needless to say it remained uncleaned on check out two days later. Location only good point.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Very Good Stayed here for business in Brooklyn, the location was great, just a block from where I was working. Overall a great hotel, well maintained and very clean (especially when compared to previous experiences in 'upscale' Manhattan hotels).Food was very good, and restaurant/bar staff friendly. My only issue was with the noise from the adjacent room that came through the connecting door. This seems to be a common problem with Marriotts, in my experience (maybe with all hotels as well, but I stay almost exclusively at Marriotts.) A fussy toddler kept me awake until 1:30AM, ugh. Beautiful views from the Concierge Lounge, and presumably from bridge-view rooms.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. Our room was a really good size and very comfortable. Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee, it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10:30am. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs, bacon, toast etc. We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

If you call thirty mintues before needing your car it should be there for you.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Great Location, Great Value Great location right behind the Cathedral. Friendly staff. Large rooms, and the restaurant serves AWESOME chocolate flan!!A couple drawbacks are that there is no A/C and the beds are very firm, but then i guess if you like firm beds that wont be a problem. I've made this my preferred hotel for trips to MXC!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
Will always return... I have stayed here a number of times (for weeks at a time) and have had not only superior service but excellent accomodations. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are large. It is across the street from Eaton Center and the PATH downtown. You can walk to almost anywhere! The exercise facilities are fantastic as well..####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Fantastic meals and very nice spa The meals are fantastic, especially the buffet breakfasts. The Sunday brunch is unbelievably decadent and a great value despite the high price. The spa is very nice; I had a great pedicure and haircut. The rooms are on the small size, but they are extremely well designed, especiallt he bathroom. Our original room was overlooking a parking lot, but after we asked to be switched we were given a beautiful room with an ocean view.####[['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Grate time My sister and I, haved a grate time on this big and beautiful hotel. We stayed in a standard room, very clean and lovely. The principal buffet and the snack at the pool were not very good but all the other restaurant was ok. But the best was an afternoon at the spa, we enjoyed it...####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Great Small Hotel This is a great small hotel. The beds are very comfortable and it located with a park on one side of the hotel and the beach a few steps from the other side. I would recommend this if you done want to stay a one of the big hotels and if you want great customer service. I found it to be a very relaxing hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great hotel, staff, and location We stayed at the Hotel St. Marie in early April. We were there with a reunion of Marines from Baker Co. who fought in the Korean War. The hotel surpassed our expectations-very clean and convenient to everything in the French Quarter. The entire staff, from Timothy Lawrence, General Manager, to the bell men were more than pleasant and helpful. I would definitely choose to stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Smiley's Restaurant We didn't stay at the hotel, but ate at the attached restaurant. It was, by far, the best meal we had in Rincon. The atmosphere is very romantic and the service was great. OUr meal took a little longer because of a big party and the waiter bought our drinks. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more romantic night out.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Superb hotel We went to Berlin for the Xmas markets and decided to stay at this hotel because of the very good feedback reviews on tripadvisor. For the money, it is one of the best European hotels that we have stayed in - we were surprised at how large the rooms were. It is also ideally situated and in very quiet street. The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was not included in the price but we found a small cafe just around the corner where we could purchase rolls, sandwiches, croissants etc at a fraction of the price that the breakfast in the hotel would have cost. Thoroughly recommended - you won't be disappointed.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Nice but noisy Location is the problem here. Didn't feel safe to walk outside but the front desk got cabs with ease. Very noisy outside, double glazing would help. Room excellent, staff excellent, facilities excellent, restaurant/bar excellent, reasonably priced, shuttle to airport excellent. If it were somewhere else it would get a 5!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
We had a great stay at Carabela Bavaro Club Resort We had a wonderful stay. The accomadations were great and the food was great also. It was very relaxing with no pressure to do anything that we didn't want to do. We met alot of good people which we have kept in touch with since we got home. I would definately book at this resort again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
The staff hate Americans! The staff were rude, spiteful, and went out of their way to make my stay unpleasant. The room was average, the breakfast not so bad. If you in any way resemble an American, look elsewhere. The only one staff person who spoke English worked in the morning and she was absolutely unbelievably nasty.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral']]
Delightful and Romantic!! We stayed at this hotel with friends. We decided to spend about $50 more per night, but our room was spectacular, while theirs was average or below. Still, even they were satisfied with the stay because they saved money and the location was ideal for our tastes. Really a wonderful hotel, but don't spare the expense. It's worth every penny!!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great Hotel The hotel was very clean, comfortable and in a superb location right in the centre of Amsterdam(Dam Sq/Red Light).

Stayed 1 night Only one thing to say Ask your rep for a move to a 5* Hotel. Take no excuses  get out. Thats what I did and I ended up in a much better hotel in Bavaro with a view from my room overlooking the whole of Bavaro bay - a view to die for.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great experience! The new remodeled rooms are very beautiful and comfortable. New ammenities like bigger closet and sofa to watch TV where totally unexpected for me.

Not bad Hotel was about 20-25 minute walk to the centre of Florence. The room was clean, with a good shower and the staff were friendly. The only downside were the banging of doors late at night and in the early hours from other guests 'coming and going'. It did get on your nerves after a while and stopped a good nights sleep. Probably wouldn't stay here again for that reason.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Be Warned: Polyester Sheets First of all, this place is really really cheap, so I feel a little bad complaining, also the staff were genuinely concerned when i brought this matter to their attention,however, the sheets here are some kind of polyester blend, so even though it may be freezing cold outside, you will not need to turn on the heat, you will sweat up a storm and wake up wet. I didn't sleep too well once i realized i was sleeping on a mattress that must be drenched with the sweat of a thousand previous guests.i would not stay here again, even with it being cheap.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
A Very Refreshing and Stylish Hotel Since the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the warmth that their staff offered to me and my family. The room was very cozy and clean. Their restaurant, Panorama, located at the top of the hotel had friendly personell and offered a relaxing ambience with a view to the harbour. Definitely would stay there if we visit once again!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]

Loved the Langham Our family stayed at the Langham for 4 days. The location was excellent, and conveniently located near the ferries and lots of shopping (isn't that why you go to Hong Kong?)

Beds were fantastic Stayed at the Best Western Coconut Waikiki for just two nights. The staff was most helpful and accomodating. The rooms were small but nice and clean and modern. The bed was one of the most comfortable my husband and I have ever slept on. A bit of a walk to the beach but doable especially with a stop just down the street for a great three dollar mai tai.####[['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved The Mansion on Turtle Creek My husband and I stayed at the Mansion on Turtle Creek following our wedding.

Nice Place I satyed four nights at the hotel for a conference and found it to be a fine establishment. I was in a distant section that made access to the lobby and conference section quite a hike but was near to the spa and pool which proved to be an advantage. The pool is immense and, as a swimmer, was most welcome. The food was tasty and well presented and the location was very convenient for access to lots of transportation and local activities.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Encapsulates the heart of Florence We spent a few days here at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have picked a nicer spot. We fell in love with Florence and also with this hotel which, for us, encapsulated the heart of this beautiful city with its relaxed elegance and warm spirit. We had a very 'Florentine' room with a view' and a great bed, the best of friendly attention from our hosts, a good breakfast and a super location. In the grim early- winter days which are fast enveloping the North of Ireland, we think about our 'time out' in this little Florentine idyll all the time and hope some day to return. Thanks for everything.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora - Spend your money elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora this week (departed 16/8/06). The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling. We realised that the breakfast charges of 330,000 R for breakfast for two was way over the top, and started visiting outside the resort. Everything works, it鈥檚 all nice, but it feels like nobody鈥檚 there, and its not fun.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol. True--but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels' and it's a 20 euro cab ride. My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties--a reservation canceled without notice, a free wifi system that was down (a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords), a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks. This hotel is in a suburban business district--it may be very convenient and useful on workdays; my very short stay there, on a Saturday, after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip, was nothing but a series of frustrations.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative']]
xcellent location and great value for money We have just arrived back from Amsterdam yesterday. Our stay at the Hotel Luxer was a very, very enjoyable stay. Very clean, friendly staff and a great location. We arrived at the hotel at 11am on our first day to drop our bags in reception as the check-in time is at 2pm. We were given our room key and offered breakfast which was a great bonus as we could eat and freshen up after traveling! We highly recommend this hotel and we will be booking another stay later this year!!!!!!!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive']]
IDEAL for large groups. Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30's and 40's. Found it to be a good quality ,well run, clean hotel. Staff were all very curteous and welcoming (even when returning from nights out at 5.30AM) and rooms were clean and adequate. Didn't sample the food - plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars within 50 yards. Steps to (excellent) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport (get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T-10 ticket that allows 10 journeys).Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro's a day is a bit stiff.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
In the center of Tokio We stayed in this hotel with a soccer team for the intercontinental soccer cup for 6 days. Everything is 5 star, the rooms, the food, the service etc..

great everything Booked this hotel through Last Minute.com when my other hotel booking was in euros and needed a better deal. This hotel was first class, on arrival at reception got served immediately given all the info I needed with maps and details of trips and buses. room was very clean, the bed was huge, the buffet breakfast was brilliant and catered for every taste. The hotel was a 5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port, with regular buses and a metro stop outside.

Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you'd go to if you want a really upscale, romantic place to stay. BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam. It's a two minute walk to the Dam Square, 10 minute walk to the Central Station and within easy walking distance of everything in central Amsterdam. The hotel is clean and quiet an comfortable, but I would say the key selling point is the fact that it is so well located.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
peace in a great location We spent two nights here last weekend and it lived up to all of this site's positive reviews. The bed and room were small but wonderful and so quiet.

Like a spacious apartment Our room at the Lenox was enormous. It was a perfect oasis to return to each night, with a huge bathroom and a separate closet room. Staff were excellent and friendly and the location was perfect, being close to Newberry Street and Boylston Street shops and restaurants. The king size bed did slope into the middle a little, but we still found it comfortable. Strongly recommended.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive']]

Fantastic Stayed over a weekend in feburary, 2008. Every facet of the experience was excellent (and also expensive). The service was courteous  professional, the rooms were large by european standards and very well appointed. The grounds of the hotel were elegant yet unpretentious. Next time i go, i will splurge on the extravagant champagne opera brunch (70 euro/person) in the dining room, which is featured on the cover of Time Out Madrid.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Great find - family hotel in the heart of New York City Found this hotel quite by accident and what a find... Location is just off times square - right in the middle of the action. Hotel is themed on North African theme and it completely works, the friendly attentitive staff actually seem to care about your well being and you don't feel as though you are a corporate number. In particular the free cheese and wine every evening helps to make you night out complete, they do this because they don't (didn't) have a liquor licence.breakfast is continental style - but again included in the price. The rooms are big (for New York) and a welcome change from the chain hotels - with fans as well as the usual AC. The only downside was leaving - great place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Hotel is a in a great location (safe, walking distance to the French Quarter etc), and absolutely gorgeously decorated with various artworks. Friendly and helpful front desk too.

Great hotel It was so beautiful there, and we would love to go back!! The thing is you cant really leave the resort, at least we didnt, as its kind of dangerous too. You have to stay within your resort. The good thing is if you stay at the Riu, there are 4 other Riu resorts you have access too!, so you can check out the others. Weather was beautiful, and beaches were gorgeous####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

Pleasantly surprised! I stayed here over a weekend and paid a ridicously low rate, so I wasn't expecting much. The concierge was very helpful and the beautiful hotel bar is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine and listen to piano, or later in the night, the jazz quartet. My room was very large, my only complaint is the plumbing is still very old (it took a long time for the hot water). Otherwise this place is a gem and a nice change of pace from the cookie-cutter chains.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
A great value right next to the French Quarter I needed an alternate hotel near the Sheraton on Canal, where I was attending a conference. I found the Country Inn  Suites on Magazine Street to be reasonably priced, clean and convenient in location to my conference and to the French Quarter. The rooms are small, but the building is architecturally interesting as a combination of three older buildings that were remodeled into a hotel. The free breakfast buffet has a good selection as well. Overall, a good buy!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Be wary! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc. However, I found there was some rather foul stains (females staying along do not make marks like that) on the duvet cover, which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc. Really not acceptable in a hotel aiming to be top tier and fairly disgusting. So check your bedsheets before climbing into bed there.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative']]

Gem in a Non-Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed. I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don't know about this place. We got great service, a great view, a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels (e.g., the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical/health activities). I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them. I can see why -- nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes (mostly) of tourists. I want to stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
