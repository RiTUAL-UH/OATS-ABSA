Fantastic service I am a travel agent booking hotels all over the world, so we are very very fussy. This hotel offers customer service at its' best. Great location, great service, nothing is too much bother. The rooms are great, cheaper than some of the well known names and frankly far better. Stay here and give yourself a treat with staff who really do genuinely care. We will continue to book our clients here, as it gives a great satisfaction to offer them such an outstanding property.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
venient, helpful  I stayed here as a single female and it was a great place to be. The concierge was able to recommend great restaurants and trips, and the hotel is right next to lots of the sights, and the cable car turnaround so it's easy to get anywhere. Downside - I would have preferred facilities other than the adjoining seafood restaurant for breakfast etc. Definitely recommend.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Loved Le Pavillion We go to New Orleans frequently for business and for pleasure. This was the first time that we had stayed at Le Pavillion. It was wonderful! The staff was personable and professional. The room was a little small, but if you are in New Orleans you are not in your room that much. I can definitely say that Le Pavillion will be our hotel of choice from now on.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Great anniversary night! We were able to check in early (probably as it was a slow day - the Saturday of a three day weekend) and the desk clerk, when entering our Hilton rewards card number, found out it was our 32nd anniversary. She upgraded us to a fabulour corner room, facing the harbor and gave us complimentary access to the executive suite hospitality room. The staff were all very nice, from the bell man who gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do once we got there, to the desk clerk, to the health club attendant, to the shuttle bus drivers. Would stay there again in a heart beat! Was only sad it was a one night stand at the end of our vacation!####[['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Up to our expectations An excellent stay at the Elysee. We had a wonderful large room on 14th Floor which had a balcony and view which was just what we asked for. The breakfast and afternoon cheese and wine were really enjoyed. The hotel is ideally situated close to main attractions and Central Park and just across the road from Metro but in a very quiet road. Would definitely stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Budget This hotel is a typical budget down town Amsterdam hotel. In other words, its not for you if you are looking for something nice and cosy. It's for you who are looking for cheaper great location, walking distance to the centrum and Amsterdam Centraal station. It's not to clean and rooms are small, typical down town European. I stay there because of price and location only and only when I'm alone, would not offer it for family.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'neutral']]
Fabulous place in Florence My sister and I spent seven days at IlGuelfoBianco in Florence and wish it had been longer. The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Their information on the sights of Florence was very accurate and they did not hesitate to make helpful suggestions. The rooms are beautifully restored with historical furniture. We felt that we found our home away from home.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Lovely Quiet Quality Hotel I have had the pleasure to stay at this hotel twice in the past few months and was very impressed with it. The staff are very friendly, the hotel is very clean and quiet and so close to all in the city. The location being next to Central Railway Station is an asset and make it very easy to get to all locations whilst on holidays. The renovations to this hotel have made it nice and fresh with quality fittings and a pleasure to spend time in.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Realy nice hotel, enjoyed staying there Really nice hotel. Modern, excellent beds, great location (even though is was near rembrandt square ti was very quiet), really helpful staff, breakfast ok, the bathroom was with glass walls so a little bit embarassing if you want your privacy.

Avoid like the Plague Have traveled to Amsterdam over 10 times and never stayed in anywhere so TERRIBLE. The rooms were tiny (2 beds in 1 room and 3 in another). The bed was for someone aged 5 or under and the views of a concrete wall were awful. After checking out i was told i had to clean my own room which i did and then 1 week later was charged and extra 150 euros for what i don't know. I'm persuing legal action so avoid this place like the plague.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]

Really average service Really ordinary service. Not able to place any call from the room (local-long distance), nobody could help up (in 2 different rooms). Breakfast is great. Rooms are big.

>Does the job ! A perfect place to crash whilst in transit through Frankfurt . This Hotel is clean, cheap, ideally situated next to the Central train station and staffed by friendly and professional people who do their jobs very well.

Loved It After reading the reviews on this site, I was terrified of my choice, but had already paid in full through Expedia. The hotel turned out better than I expected and I completely relaxed. Room was charming, although it was the absolute smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in, and the bathroom was really itty bitty!Didn't have much contact with the staff, but what contact I did have was pleaseant. I arrived at the hotel at 11 a.m. was allowed to check in, which helped me enjoy a full day in San Francisco without worrying about check in times, etc. I took Bart from the airport and highly recommend it over taking a $40 or more taxi ride.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Very good hotel We booked this hotel for the last night of our vacation using our Marriott rewards points. We didn't expect much but it actually turned out great.

Obsessed with this hotel! We got a great deal on Orbitz for this amazing hotel. The location is outstanding, smack between the Duomo and Piazza Signoria. We had a room facing the back, from which we could open our windows to overlook the picturesque Florentine rooftops and an overwhelming view of the Duomo itself! Our room was huge; comfortable and modern furniture, a very clean and beautiful bathroom (maybe a tad on the small side) but a separate sitting room with a sofa/twin bed and separate TV with its own amazing view. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Superb! My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights (and mornings and afternoons) at Matteo's beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal. His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated, and treat each other, like old friends. The wonderful terrace, for breakfast and evening spritzers and whatever else you'd like, provides the remarkable setting. Although near the Rialto bridge, serenity reigns. Al Ponte Antico is a magical place and we will return again and again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

It has a enchanting patio with tropical flowers, terracota tiles and a marvlous mobiliary, a little but confortable pool and very kind personnel.

OK, but The hotel is located ideally for tourism. If they offer you a room around by the pool, DO NOT TAKE IT!! These rooms are not refurbished, noisy surroundings (generartors etc).

>No Internet access in hotel rooms !! The hotel itself is of average quality but there is no Internet access of any type in hotel rooms! The staff could be somewhat more polite and helpful (at least in opinion of someone used to European standards). If you use the shower be aware that you may get burned as the valve system is obsolete and not well maintained. The hotel is located very close to the airport, but not so easy to find as there are no road signs indicating proper direction and the hotel name is not visible from main roads.####[['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

agree with previous re bedrooms I agree with the previous review- the bedrooms let the hotel down - there is obviously a variety of bedrooms. Our first bedroom was on the fourth floor at the back with a view of the inner courtyard - would have been fine if the room had not been so hot.

Silly Style Over Substance I spent two nights at the W recently and had to supress myself from laughing on several occasions.

clean and New Hotel This is a very new hotel, it is a non-smoking hotel, which was pleasant. The location is very close to the center, tram way is outside the hotel about 1 mins walk, and there is a bike hire place on the basement of the hotel which was very convenient as cycling is one of the easiest way to get around Amsterdam in the day or at night. The room is very big and the toilet is state of the art. Only complain is the free wifi is on the slow side of things.

ustomer Service is amazing! When it comes right down to it, the Renew is a great place to stay because of the attitude of the staff who take customer service very seriously and did everything that they could to make my one week stay comfortable.

Avoid at all costs How this place can call itself a 4.5/5 star hotel is beyond me - obviously the management have no grasp of hospitality unless they previosuly ran a prison or similar. Room wasn't clean, service non existent bordering on don't care attitudes, I can honestly say that I have had better experiences in BBs. Dreadful, simply dreadful.

Rip off! Consumer beware! Arrived to find a depressingly hot, dank, tiny, shabby UNACCEPTABLE room for the $175+taxes. Although I agreed to pay their $50 cancellation fee, my credit card was charged $196.75 for NO services rendered. Surely they rented the room twice that night (April 20) and somebody pocketed some easy money!I want a refund.

11 days in HK We stayed at the South Pacific Hotel from 07/03/2006-16/03/2006 and found our stay to be most enjoyable. The hotel is quite basic,with a bar fridge and kettle,very clean and well located in Wanchai,with shops (two good bakeries nearby) and Times Square an easy walk, transport is very close. The concierge, the doorman and the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive. The twin bed room was more spacious than the double room, the beds are easy enough to push together. We would have no hesitation in returning to this budget hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Nice place to stay The Residence Michalangiolo has fantastic rooms, and is run by the nicest freindliest people you could hope to meet. It is easy walking distance to the centre of Florence or there is a great inexpensive bus service. As there is no restarant and bar if you are hoping to meet other guests this hotel is not for you, but with a hotplate and fridge cleverly hidden in the room it is great if you want to do your own thing. You can drink your own drinks on a terrace or in the garden.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
New York's finest hotel This is the best hotel in New York - over the years i have stayed in many for business and pleasure, but if you are spending your own money and want value and a lovely place to stay, this is the place. We had a park view room and waking up was a pleasure. indeed the curtains were never shut. What sets this hotel apart is the location and the extra amenities - the bar is one of the best in NY and the concierge can't help enough and it's all done unintrusively.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Not a 5 Star - Need refurbish This Hotel can NOT be considered as a 5 Star Hotel. The Bathroom was a old fashioned conditioned and the room seems like you were on the 80麓s. I am Spanish and I am used to go to 3 Star Hotels which are less than half the price of this Hotel and with double quality (Bathroom and room). The Breakfast (almost 30 euro) is expensive and not worth it. This Hotel need to de refurbish!!!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

Rather Disappointed! Dear Reader,after our recent one night stay at the Bali Hyatt, we unfortunately have to confirm the negative review written by LukePerth dated Nov 18, 2008. Our room was very humid and loud, which may relate to the structural set-up of the hotel property. We think that it could be worthwhile to invest some more $$$ and stay at the Sheraton Laguna Beach Resort in Nusa Dua.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Good Hotel Booked a package through Eurostar, a nice modern hotel near the peripeherique, 5 mins walk to the metro and then 15 mins into the centre of Paris. In the centre of conference / tradeshow town so could be busy. A good room, clean and tidy and attentive staff. A check in problem was expertly and politely solved. bar expensive and you are better off taking breakfast in a local bar than the hotel (15 euro buffet anyone?). Recommended for a long weekend, we'll stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Worthy of the Praise All we can do is echo the praise that other reviewers have bestowed upon this wonderful oasis. What an endearing spot! We felt welcome from the moment we arrived via the tiny elevator until the time of our all too soon departure. The other reviews accurately describe the warm and friendly atmosphere of this gem. We would stay at the Colomba again in a heartbeat and strongly encourage all to do the same.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Loved it! The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful property located close to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City. It's located a floor or two above a large shopping center (handy as there are banks, drugstores and quick/cheap places to eat). We stayed on the club level which meant check in was in our room (nice touch), we had a separate concierge (albeit not speaking english as well as those in the lobby) and a delicious free breakfast and afternoon drinks. We had the grand suite - a nice bedroom with separate living/work area.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Excellent Expereince - Great Service The hotel was amazing. The Decor was really modern and nice, The hotel was clean and beds were confortable. The staff very helpful, they directed us on how to save hundreds on show tickets, where most hotels would only offer you there services, stadd multiple times showed us the best options which were outside the hotels services. We had a end corner room which had an elevator next to it, felt like we had our own private elevator (only once in 4 day was another person in it).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['polarity positive', 'positive']]

Great fitness center, free internet at the business center, friendly, friendly, helpful staff, very clean room, 5 star service in a 3-4 star hotel.

Excellent hotel, we'll stay there again. My wife and I enjoyed staying at this excellent hotel and will definitely stay there again whenever we are in Los Angeles. The room was excellent and the staff were pleasant and helpful. The facilities including restaurant, bar, grounds and laundry were excellent.

w favorite hotel in theatre district I found this hotel perfect for my needs--good area, large enough room, clean, friendly staff, not ridiculously expensive. I even had a view--which is not often the case in less expensive New York Hotels. I booked an Executive double double and it was nicely renovated, and felt fresh. Perfect for going to plays, taking the subway , and finding good resturants close by.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Superb breakfast view Ok, I'm a little biased because Berlin in the snow in mid-February is inspiring, but this was a superbly located hotel, with great facilities and very helpful staff (whose English is far better than mein Deutsche). My girlfriend pointed out that were it slightly further up the Ku'damm, by only about 75 metres, it would be more expensive to reflect the slight-change in area, so it really is a bargain. I've never been in a hotel where for such little outlay you have a MASSIVE bath in a marble bathroom, set in a large, well laid-out clean and comfortable room. My top tips would be to have the (very ample buffet) breakfast there, whilst enjoying the view from the 6th floor -fruhstuck even runs until 10, so you can still have a bit of a lie-in; and to get a City/ Welcome card, as the hotel is very close to stations for all the forms of transport (except trams, being located in the West), thereby utilising its much raved about location. We would eagerly use it again.####[['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Good find in Paris A good hotel away from the main touristy areas of Paris. Staff were very friendly, helpful and the accomodation was a fair size. Although the bathroom in my room seemed a little dated compared to others in the hotel, the whole room very clean and comfortable offering excellent value for money. Location wise, the hotel has plenty of cafes and restuarants nearby as well as some excellent patisseries. It's between two metro stops and one metro stop down from the Gare de Nord, so for getting around public transport / in and out of Paris it was ideal.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

Great location; Comfortable hotel - shame about the building We picked the Radisson by chance out of a very long list of Boston hotels. Despite being the ugliest building in Boston it is a comfortable hotel whose location is fantastic for most of the central Boston attractions.

Location, Location, Location! The location is everything with this hotel, you can even catch the train from Sydney airport and get off right opposite! The room we were originally allocated was upgraded (free of charge) due to a misunderstanding about the bed available for the third person staying with us. We booked via an internet site and were charged $AU140 per night for two nights with a $AU45 tariff for the extra person.

Fantastic pools, shame about teh beach replenishment Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in October 2008, and whilst the rooms were pretty bland the pools and outside areas facing the beach are lovely. 3 pools - one infinity, one with a pool bar and a spa pool. The hotel is right on the beach but the beach was being replenished during our stay so you couldn't actually use it and had to walk to the main Kuta beach (about 5 - 10 minutes). All, in all though this is a good holiday hotel and the staff were always very friendly.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Location and Service Impeccable I stayed here for a convention that was held a few blocks away and was blown away at how incredibly perfect everything was. The price was super reasonable. The service was perfect. The accommodations and amenities left nothing more to be desired (except maybe an indoor pool but not a big deal in my opinion). Not to mention the location was in the dead heart of everything and walking distance to the convention center.

xcellent resort March 27, 2005We returned from Punta Cana yesterday and still are amazed at how wonderful the resort was. Especially the calm...quiet breeze, waves crashing on the shore, wide open beach, lots of empty lounge chairs waiting for us, and no vendors. The food was amazing, especially the breakfast buffet. There was so much choice and everything was beautifully prepared. The wine we were served is good quality. Champagne was available at all times!We would return, and recommend this place to everyone.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Highly Recommended We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location and found this to be the perfect choice. Although it is not especially plush the Moore Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great location and spacious room Can't argue with the location (short walk to Universal Studios, short drive to Hollywood and downtown), or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom. Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day (you will need time to explore LA). Only downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access. Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances. Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced (extra to cost of room) Overall, pretty good, just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]

firmed reservation, but no room available when we arrived I reserved two rooms several months in advance and confirmed them via email one week before arrival. Nonetheless, we were apologetically told by the staff that they had overbooked and had no rooms available and were transferring us to its sister hotel Colon. Unfortunately, the Colon Hotel rooms turned out to be run down, with stained upholstery, linens, and carpeting, no air conditioning, and an old, lumpy bed. We found a new hotel. I never saw the rooms at the Regencia, so I can't comment on them (the lobby was simple but clean), but the experience was disappointing and stressful as we scrambled to find an acceptable hotel.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Friendly, Comfortable and welcoming Recently had an excellent stay in this friendly and comfortable hotel. The welcoming and efficient staff made everything go very smoothly and our room was lovely. The hotel is very handily placed for London Bridge mainline and tube and for the attractions of the southbank (Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre and Borough Market) all in easy walking distance, although it would be a good base for any visit to London. I've stayed in a number of well known central London hotels but this is the one I will return to.

Good for a Stop over We had a somewhat small room in the 鈥渢ower鈥?section of the hotel, which I think is mainly used by stopover passengers en route to Australia. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was very clean and welcoming. Wardrobe space was somewhat limited after luggage storage and the small sit in bath required careful negotiation in order to stand in a flat area for a shower. The room although small was pleasant enough but the lighting was very poor and I found it very difficult to read standard size font (such as 11 of 12 point) after it had got dark.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Enjoyed the Orchard Experience Booked this Hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The Hotel is small but very reasonably priced for the area.

A Doggie Hotel, Not for People The smell and stains in hallways and in rooms tells everything..... this hotel caters to people with dogs. We checked into our room and the stench of dog with potent cleaning solution smell practically knocked us over.

So if you don't mind paying to stay in a room where dogs have obviously been, then Summerfield may be just the place for you.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Rude people at the QT Bartender in the hotel was a jerk and used strong language towards my wife and I. After complaining to the manager, she made us feel like it was our fault for requesting a drink around midnight. Don't call the hotel for rates, shop through Hotels or something similar for best rates. Another couple traveling with us got a cheaper rate by doing so, and the manager would not match their rate. OK location, 1/2 a block from time squ. Not sure if I would ever stay there again.

Satisfied I stayed here for 3 nights. Check in was brisk and the room was adequate - neat, not too large yet not too small (considering this is Hong Kong). Location was good, near the hustle and bustle of Times Square. For everything else, there is always the MTR!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Best Location in Barceloma This is possibly the best located hotel in Barcelona - right in front of the Gothic Quarter, and only 5 minutes walk to La Ramblas (just far enough away). Also, right on the harbour front which is ideal for restaurants and shopping. Room and service were excellent and highly recommended####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Value for money The location is excellent right next to Centraal Station. The rooms are small but cleanBreakfast is adequateFree Porn channel for those interested. To sum up it is what it is a cheap hotel at a cheap price. If you want a luxorious hotel pay more and get one if you just want a nice clean cheap room in an excellent location.

Great location This hotel is in a great location in terms of a walking distance to key Fisherman's Wharf attractions. From the Wharf area you can catch a trolley car or sightseeing bus to other parts of the City. Overall the hotel is great for the value. The lobby is large with a warm atmosphere and helpful concierge desk. The room we had was well furnished and clean, but it was small with no view; however, we were not paying a top rack rate and had no plans to spend much time in the room anyway.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Best hotel we've ever stayed in This hotel is absolutely suberb - perfect location (10 min walk to main shopping street and 15-20 min walk to Forbidden City / Tian'anmen Square); very efficient, helpful and friendly staff who speak good english; and the rooms / leisure facilities are excellent. Very good breakfast and the one evening meal we had there was first class too. All in all a perfect hotel from which to see Beijing from and the best hotel we've ever stayed in.p.s. when walking around Beijing take toilet paper with you as the public loos don't provide it!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Good Hotel, Good location Hotel Aalders was the best choice we could have made. Good location, nice hotel with extreme friendly staff. The staff was a big help to reserve several tours for us as explaining where to go in Amsterdam without feeling a tourist!!!!Our room was clean and comfortable with television, telephone and in the bathroom bath, toilet, sink, hair and shower gel and a hairdryer!!!At the hotel bar you could use the internet service at any time. Breakfast was good with different choices and we could come in to the hotel at anytime of the day or night because of the day and night receptionists.

classy hotel Classy hotel, in a classy part of barcelona, near to all the sights, a bit of a walk to las ramblas so a bit further away from the party scene. very helpful staff, rooms very tastefully decorated with nice bathrooms. turn down service and a pillow menu! some of the rooms do differ considerably in size though, maybe ask for a larger room,,also the rooftop pool is only really aplunge pool but the rooftop is lovley to sit out and have a few relaxing drinks.breakfast very expensive!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Great if it weren't for the desk staff Beds, location and cleanliness were excellent. HOWEVER, the front desk screwed up a simple Kinkos delivery for me, and my traveling companion's reservation- then tried assigning blame on him despite his ability to produce confirmation numbers and dates. All ended well, but customer service was AMAZINGLY bad. Probably fine for tourist travel, but be warned that for business travel this is the worst Starwood property we've ever stayed in.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
A Beautiful Place in a Very Good Location Stayed here for three nights in June 2008, 2 adults and 2 teenagers in the annex rooms, second (third) floor. An absolutely beautiful place, clean and new with real Venetian decor (go to the Ca'Rezzonico museum and see the same style furniture you have in your room!). Breakfast was very good featuring home made apple croissants. I am a super light sleeper and on the first night heard noises from the private residence above our room - Walter and Sandro at the front desk contacted owner of the building the next day and immediately resolved the issue, they were super nice and helpful. Not hard to walk to this hotel from the train station - save some money on the overpriced vaporetto tickets and head there on foot.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
great location but extras missing My family and I stayed here for 4 nights before going to Cape Cod.this hotel is a great base for seeing all the sights in boston. Our room in the north tower was quiet and comfortable but had some drawbacks-bathroom shabby and basic. No refridgerator for kids drinks/water.

Great hotel, excellent location We (a group of 10) stayed at the H10 Marina in June 2008 on a hen weekend, and I would highly reccomend this hotel. It is clean, well kept with minimalist modern decor and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The location is also great, about 10 minutes walk from the bars at Port Olympic. The pool area is quite small, so if that is a priority for you it may not be ideal, but as we didn't have time for sunbathing that was no issue.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Fine but pricey stayed here for a long weekend - nice hotel and obviously can't beat the location - we were in the castle club which is worth the extra money as had 'character breakfasts' every morning - that way you can gets lots of photos and avoid eating in the hotel for lunch and dinner - had the buffet at the Inventions restaurant one night which was awful - go up to the Disney Village if you want to eat something decent for half the price - there is a planet hollywood and a few other acceptable chains in the village - good standard of room but OD'd on the air freshner - very comfy beds - staff were fine - kids loved the weekend though which is the whole point - still considering the cost could make a better effort to feed the grown ups####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Friendly, helpful staff This Hotel is located near Moulen Rouge, with small but adequate rooms. The staff were VERY HELPFUL, even the manager offered to allow us to leave our big luggage there for a small trip to London. Also all staf spoke english, which was a big plus!!!! In fact the only reason I would return to Paris is because of the great service we got at the hotel and the pub next door, everywhere else seemed unfriendly and offered little help.

Great hotel I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great. Room was very small but was perfect for us, it had all we needed including a minibar and a very nice bathroom. We stayed for three nights in total, it may be a bit small for people on a longer stay (1 week).As mentioned in other reviews, it have a more of a BB feel than a hotel feel so if you are looking for somewhere more like a hotel then I would look elsewhere. Would definetely recommend Residence Foch, the area was perfect, literally max ten mins walk from the Arc de Troimph, lovely safe area.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Tradeoffs This location has huge tradeoffs. The good news is that this is a convenient tourist area with amusing sights such as street performers.

Dull This hotel is standard business hotel. It's in a fairly dull location, the rooms are spacious and clean, but there is nothing to get excited about at all.

Seriously lacking This particular Four Seasons property was absolutely forgettable. From the moment we pulled up, the service was way below expectation....sitting in the car with the luggage for several minutes (no bellhop) and having to re-circle the property to get help with the bags, to the missed wake-up call, to waiting for 45 minutes for a coctail server to approach our table in the lounge... everything seemed to be a bit off. The saving grace of this hotel (aside from the great location)would be front desk/management team. They were overall very professional and super courteous.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Beautiful Hotel in the Middle of Tokyo After staying in the Akasaka Excel Hotel, we moved to the Prince because it was cheaper and are we glad we did!

Such elegance! I loved The Kimberly! It's small, as hotels go, but I never felt claustrophobic in it and especially not in my room. The parlor was comfortable, the kitchen surprisingly complete, and the bedroom was QUITE spacious with an awesome bed. The staff was delightful, especially the doorman, an older African American man, who was quick with a smile and never, ever gave me the feeling he was looking for a tip (which made me tip him more!).It's conveniently located to many midtown attractions and also the subway at 51st and Lexington. I would definitely stay here again, but word to the wise: make sure you get your car out of the garage within a 24 hour time period or they will charge you for an extra day, even if you're only a minute or two late!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
absolute rip off Pretty good by the book for the star rateing EXCEPT the HOWARD JOHNSON part. I was charged more for an international call that lasted barely 1 minute to Australia by the HOWARD JOHNSON organisation than I paid for the room!!!!!!! Beware local calls dialed through the hotel system are very inexpensive BUT by the telephone in the room are instructions to make international calls useing your credit card. I did this, the conections are made thru US, thru the HOWARD JOHNSON org. and that as far as I'm concerned is a RIP OFF.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Hoped for more I went on Orbitz.com to book the hotel and was quite excited after reading the reviews and seeing pictures of the hotel.

Good location, comfy beds Rooms were great although the bedroom area was a little on the small side, the bathrooms and comfortable beds really made up for this. All sights within easy walking distance - 5 mins walk to the flower market and 15-20 mins to Museumplein. Near to metro, trams and canalbus stops. Just round the corner from the hotel is Utrechtsestraat which contains some of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. During our stay there was a lot of unexpected construction work (both to us and the hotel) which the hotel kindly compensated us for.

Watertown Hotel -- Amazing! This place is a dream -- we had a great, spacious room. There's a funky, modern, upbeat feeling to the lobby and all of the public spaces.

For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous.

Although the rooms are smaller, this property and its staff make up for the shortcome.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
it is what it is having seen some of these reviews i had to coment yes its not a five star hotel but then it dosnt claim to be and the pool will certainly leave you amazed (if not happy), but hey you pay a fraction what you would pay in the hilton village and you can easily walk there and spend all your day there on the best stretch of beach in waikiki all in all this hotel is what it says it is, a great base to explore waikiki from, clean friendy and reasonably priced####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]

Excellent service at a cost Good location on a side road of Orchard Road, but not necessarily the best location as Orchard Road is like Oxford St in London, busy and full of tourists. The service was amazing, using your name when you check in, giving you a butler etc. Rooms are excellent, well appointed and a descent size, pure luxury. Concierge and all the staff very helpful, however I did find the cost of drinks a little on the steep side, as was breakfast. Pool a little disappointing, more of a large plunge pool.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Jury's Boston Beautiful hotel, lovely rooms, but for 拢150.00 per night they should be! Only complaint was the food. Bar food expensive and not very good. For breakfast recommend Au Bon Pain. 2 minutes walk from the the hotel and excellent and extensive and cheap menu  Small friendly hotel The staff in this hotel were very friendly and helpful. The bedroom was big enough for the few days we were there. We had breakfast 3 mornings which was good value for money. Thought overall the hotel was excellent value for money in a good location and would return to this hotel if I visited Barcelona again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Mother's Day weekend Considering the price of $65/night (Priceline) it was a great stay. We had 3 rooms, all with 2 beds, at this rate and it's our 3rd year in a row winning this hotel. We use the parking lot just outside the hotel for overnight parking ($10/night), love the coffee shop for a quick snack or breakfast and haven't had issues w/the staff, service or anything.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Excellent location and view! I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotel's location, new decorum view from our 21st level room and a complementary breakfast in the early morning before our tour. I haven't visited Waikiki Beach in decades and this overnight was a great way to end our week in Hawaii. Stacey and Agnes at the Expedia Desk were extremely helpful - booking a Pearl Harbor Tour and a last minute shuttle to the airport.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
great styling Great styled hotel. got a good deal on the internet for the room with breakfast. Breakfast  restaurant were good. Prices at bar were high (800ml of water 拢5!).Door closers are a bit fierce and there were regular lod bangs from doors closing (didn't stop us sleeping though)!.Very close to Tower Hill Tube and easy to get into the city centre.

Fabulous We stayed at the fantastic Raddisson SAS Berlin over the New Year 04/05 and it's simply one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!!! As soon as you walk in, the aquarium just stuns you with its beauty and size! The staff are attentative and polite and the rooms are superb! The LCD tv's really make a difference and the room design and the 'wet room' style bathrooms are great. The spa is also one of the best! All in all, I have no hesitation in reccomending this wonderful hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Happy -- Again Having booked a standard room for our second long weekend at Ku鈥檇amm 101, we were positively surprised to be given a comfort room for the same price. The young staff was very friendly and helpful, again. When the going gets tough in the breakfast room though, the service isn鈥檛 always up to speed.

Highly recommend this quiet 2 star No more doubt as to where to spend a night or two in Paris. This two-star hotel is above average, well kept, well organised, honest and forthright. The hotel team was quick and eager to help with any projects: my wife and I felt we were a respected part of things, and Paris became accessible and comprehensible for us. We recommend the Hotel Monte Carlo.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Fantastic location We stayed here for one night on the 3rd leg of our Honeymoon and it was fantastic, we had a suite with a little kitchen and a lounge and a large bedroom. We were travelling with our 7 year old little girl. The location was great as it was only a 10 - 15 min walk to the CN Tower which was great. In the morning we received a complementary breakfast which was great and it set us up for the day. Would definatly stay here if we returned to Toronto.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Not too bad Having stayed here a number of times in the past the hotel is beginning to show wear a bit. Staff were pleasant and helpful throughout which is always as I have found it. The room facilities are as you would expect and the rooms are quite spacious (from a European point of view).I like this hotel because of it's proximity to the Central Rail Station where I can get into and out of the Airport quickly without relying on a taxi (or other transport).Food is of a reasonably good standard for breakfast. The Restaurant is highly regarded for it's Dutch food. The hotel is close to the nightlife centres without being on top of them - Dam Sq being about 5-10 mins walk.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Wonderful vacation! We stayed for 2 nights in a room we got a special deal on. This was a beautiful hotel, the decor and ambiance was exactly what we were hoping for. The pool and hot tub area was amazing, although we had hardly any time to relax we were so busy touring LA. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Diamond in the Ruff The chancelor is ideally located, seconds away from Union Square, and you can catch the trolley to take you to the trains/MUNI or just walk it, its just blocks away.

Location is just one feature here We had four great days here recently - location is fantastic given that there is so much within walking distance (including stadia and railway station), and if it rains (which is does here) transit is free in a large zone of downtown. Front desk staff could not have been more helpful and have a sense of humour, the concierge knew the answers to the questions we had, and the room was quiet and clean and comfortable. We will return....####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Hotel Allessandra was great We just returned from a 10 day stay in Italy with 3 wonderful evenings spend at the Hotel Alessandra. I highly recomend this quaint, perfectly located hotel. just 2 blocks from the Uffizzi and one block north of the Arno, the location is perfecto. More importanly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The service stands out as some of the best I have experience-the staff was very outgoing and knowledgeable with recommendations for meals.

Lovely Having stayed in the Sofitel in New York and thoroughly enjoying it - I decided to give the London one a try - and I wasn't disappointed. Very simply it was lovely!Concierge - helpful and friendlyFront desk - friendly and efficientRoom - absolutely lovely - particularly the shower! and spotlessly clean. Also really quiet due to very good double glazing - so between the quietness and the comfortable bed I had a fantastic night's sleep. Bar area - friendly.

xcellent hotel and city Just come back from Beijing, stayed 7 nights at the Crown Plaza, this is an excellent hotel, good location, spotless rooms, great service especially in the champagne bar! booked on the hotel website and payed 拢400 for the room for a week, an excellent price for this level of hotel. a few tips, make sure you get a metre taxi from the airport, and that the metre is used (we had no problems with this) cost to wangfujing street should be 90/110 yuan about 拢7.00, and takes about 40 mins. taxi to the great wall 600 yuan, that includes waiting for as long as you like we were their about 3 hrs, recommend the wall at Mutianyu, takes about 1.5 hours to get to.

Beware of leaving cash in the gift shop for postage. Very pleasant experience with one exception. The gift shop stated they out of postage and if I would leave cash, the stamps would be purchased at the post office and my post cards would be mailed for me.

While cards mailed from other locations across China, arrived at their destinations, not one of the cards left in the hotel gift shop were ever received.####[['hotel general', 'positive']]

It is very convenient to the main shopping street; the room that we had (#403) was situated at the front of the hotel - it was very comfortable and quiet; the staff is friendly and very accommodating - making dinner reservations, reconfirming air reservations, etc. I would definetely stay at this hotel should we make a return visit to Barcelona.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Too expensive, but clean and big room The hotel is situated right next to Dam sqare, in a quiet area. Location is more than perfect, walking distance to the main attractions (red light d, shopping, dam, bejighoff, central station, flower market, rembrandt, picasso).Don't expect the nice treats of a 180eur/night hotel. however, the room was quite large (around 18sqm) with a large bathroom, very clean.####[['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great location, clean with helpful staff We booked for 4 nights in mid-September as we had previously stayed here 3 years ago. Since then the hotel has been given a face-lift. The rates were higher than normal (we booked through a NL hotel booking site online) due to a big conference taking place during the week but even though they were all busy, the staff were helpful and friendly. For an extra 25 euros a night you can upgrade on arrival to a superior room (50 euros for a deluxe) which is well worth doing if you can! We asked for a room at the front and found it was well sound proofed even though you had the trams and nightlife til late!####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Great Little Boutique Hotel! The Hotel Londra is a beautiful little hotel with great accommodations, excellent service by the hotel staff, and the best dinner that we had in Italy was at the restaurant in this Hotel. Breakfast is served each morning, with a generous choice of bakery, meat, egg, fruit, and drink choices. While the location is a bit of a walk from the center of town, we enjoyed walking and seeing the community every bit as much as we enjoyed all of the historic sites. Our room was clean, spacious, and we enjoyed a magnificent view which was perfect at sunset. We will definitely stay at the Hotel Londra the next time we are in Florence.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Truly amazing Returned on 12th June - it was fabulous. Even better than the photos!In addition to all the things other people say in their reviews aboutthe pool, drinks, food, luxury room etc, I especially liked the beautiful design of the resort and lovely touches like the wonderful selection of colourful plants and flowers, parrots, flamingos, fish etc. We also enjoyed the poolside activities eg Spanish lessons, Aqua Aerobics - thanks to the activity team who did a great job. My only complaint would be the Thomas Cook rep who was hopeless and the MyTravel flights to/from London Gatwick which were the most uncomfortable flights I've ever had the misfortune to take.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Mixed review We celebrated my husband's 60th birthday and I had booked 4 rooms. We had problems with the final billing for 3 of those bills. I received an internet rate of $64 a night, but the bill indicated $127 and we were charged for a valet service that we did not have for one room. Check your billing statement. Also, the rooms were very small and our view was the room of the building next store, but for $64 I can't complain. On the other hand, great location and the staff are very nice.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Met or exceeded ALL expectations! We are a family of four (two adults and two daughters, ages 18  20). We stayed in one of the apartments for five nights and in two of the hotel rooms for one night.

School Group I brought a group of middle school students to stay here on June 3-6, 2004. The stay was fantastic. I really appreciated that there was hotel staff located on ground and then again in the hotel lobby checking to be sure that only registered guests were entering the hotel. The front desk staff, housekeepers, concierge, security, and porters were all very nice to the kids. The price of the hotel is on the moderate to high side but the location (1/2 block to the Times Square subway station), experience, and high quality made it worth it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Good standard motel Stayed here at the start end end of our Northwest States tour. Good clean rooms if not a bit 'worn' and perhaps in need of a little updating. Bathrooms very small but clean and adequate. Breakfast included in price- Juice, baguels, toast cereals, and do it yourself waffles. Airport shuttle was good and left on time (runs every half hour) only a few mins from airport.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Excellent hospitality Our large group discovered the Europa via Trip Advisor, and all the previous positive reviews are spot on. The Europa doesn't seem to appear in any guidebooks, and the entrance lobby downstairs is unpromising, but once you arrive in the hotel, Gassim and his daughter Miriam are wonderfully discreetly attentive hosts. The rooms at the back are quiet and elegantly furnished, and the hotel is perfectly placed - a couple of minutes' walk from the Duomo. Our group of 13 stayed for a week, and felt we really had found a home from home.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['polarity positive', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Easter in San Francisco We had a very nice clean room with plenty of towels for our family of four. We did not use the restaurant, but found many places within walking distance for all meals. The wharf area has plenty of eateries and things to see. This Sheraton is not a resort - so we didn't expect to dine, swim, or exercise while visiting. This is a clean safe place to stay while visiting a major US city.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
What we expected The stay was pleasurable, we stayed in the ilikai tower on the thirteenth floor. We overlooked the hilton villiage and the beautiful pacific.

Decent with good quality/price ratio, but noisy The hotel is in a good location, the rooms, at least the low priced one i got, are really small although you can survive for a week if you just sleep in there. The window in my room was loose and the first two nights it was not properly warm. I tried to put the room temperature regulation on, but the fan was really noisy, so i opted for an extra blanket. My room was facing the rear street and it was rather noisy early in the mornings. On the average, i would suggest this place, at least for the cheap rooms, to the budget conscious traveler.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
Great Rooms, Noisy Location We spent 4 nights at this hotel in Madrid. The hotel itself is in excellent condition and our room was clean and very comfortable. You could easily walk to all the sights from this location, which made it convenient. The breakfast was top notch as was the lovely rooftop bar. The hotel staff were nice, but were not at all helpful in recommending restaurants. The downside of the hotel is that it is on a very noisy street and there are many very aggressive vagrants who lurk around the hotel, not to mention hookers who work the area in the evening.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
>Sent us to other hotel although room was paid already I reserved one room for my last night (21.01) in 10 days trip around Florida and for my surprise the staff told me they did not have rooms free although I had already reserved and paid the room through expedia 2 weeks before. The excuse was that some guests had spoiled some rooms, but I think they had overbooking and sent us to the Villa Capri (5 star officially, but really 3 star quality) that is just in front of Riu, but not right on the beach. They offered us free breakfast for 3 people next day and the right to use their pool, but I do not think they are serious people as they MUST respect paid reservations. On the other side the hotel seems nice and is well located close to the beach and Lincoln Rd.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
perfect for romantic getaway This is such a cool hotel, very noirish, rat pack, 50's, space-age swingin' batchelor pad kind of vibe, with funky and artsy overtones. Very romantic if you're thinking of that kind of getaway with your loved one... great views of the city. I guess it's a little off the beaten path, but if you have a car you'll be all set. Check out the Bishop Arts district which isn't too far away.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]

Great Customer Service at the Ramada We had a problem with our reservation when we arrived because we had not booked directly with the hotel and the hotel was full.

They were great!####[['service general', 'positive']]
Great location, friendly family-run hotel Nice family-run hotel in a great location - just a couple blocks from the Duomo, Galleria dell'Accedemia, and close to many other sites (although I do recommend taking a taxi from the train station if you have luggage - cost is only about 8 Euro from the train station to the hotel). The owners and staff are extremely accomodating, offering good advice to restaurants (their recommendation of Za Za's Tratorria was so good we went back our last night), tours and anything else you need to know. They made reservations for us for dinner and a tour and we were happy with each. They take pride in making sure everyone enjoys their stay.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Loved the Hotel! We have just returned from a weekend at the Savoy Hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is magnificent and the staff provides excellent sevice.

A Great Base of Operations for Uptown Manhattan I was a bit concerned about staying at the Marquis right up until the moment we checked in. Our stay could not have been any better. Decent sized room for NYC, very quiet, great bed, helpful staff, excellent bars and restaurants, and the most efficient elevator system I have ever seen in a high rise hotel.

harming, romantic, quaint No complaints. Very, very pleasant accomodating staff. Room was lovely and quite large with a king bed and ultra comfortable mattress. Neither my husband or I felt unsafe in the area even after dark, but I can see if you're somewhat skittish you might be nervous since it isn't a high traffic area like it is right on Union Square. Great shower and vanity and loved the complimentary sodas in the fridge everyday.

Should ne upgraded to a 4 star + I recently stayed 3 nights in this hotel with my mother and have to say we couldn't have picked a better hotel. I have stayed in many a four star hotel in Italy but none compare to this hotel. The staff were fantastic always on hand to offer friendly advice from where to go on day trips to which Restaurant to eat in. We stayed in room 501 which had a fantastic view and a good size balcony. I am planning to go back to Florence in September and would definately stay in the same hotel and with a bit of luck the same room.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
lub is great! We stayed here for 3 nights in club and although the rooms are on the small side and showers lack any real power it was Jean and Joyce,the concierge, that made our stay here more than comfortable. They arranged everything from reservations in the best restaurant in the South West (Binkley's) to a hot air balloon ride over the desert, they just could not do enough! The Club lounge is exactly as a lounge should be, full of great food and masses of free drinks all through the day and more information about the area than you can shake a library at. Would highly reccommend, but only in club.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
The view is worth the money Our decision to upgrade to a room in the tower with a bay view was worth every penny!

We also enjoyed a nice dinner at Tonga.

already planning a 2nd trip we stayed at the Royal for a week this March and could not have been more pleased with the service. The hotel is beautifully kept, staff excellent. We booked with hotwire and had standard rooms, no bugs(!), and we want to return in 2 years for our 30th. The service in the Mai Tai bar could be slow, but we found the waiters to be more service minded than the waitresses, who thought they were too cute to move quick. All in all, a great experience,4 young adults, and 2 boomers.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]

Excellent This hotel lived up to our high expectations and more. Check-in staff were friendly and helpful and presented us with a room upgrade and bottle of wine since it was our honeymoon. The room itself was spacious and well designed with plasma TV, DVD player etc. The buffet breakfast was exceptional - probably the best in any hotel I've had around the world - and well worth getting included in your rate if possible.

Great hotel, shame about the price increase! We enjoyed a fantastic Mother-Daughter trip to Paris in August and were very impressed by the quality/cost ratio of Regent's Garden Hotel. We got a really nice, recently refurbished twin room for only 99 Euro (booked direct on the hotels website).However, rather large negative: A few weeks later, having been so impressed by the hotel that I was planning a second trip back there to stay with my husband, I was told by the hotel that it had just been upgraded from a 3* to a 4* hotel and that subsequently the price has increased from 99 Euros for a Classic room to 169 Euros! A huge increase which dramatically changes the 'value for money' aspect of the hotel. While I would agree that an increase was warranted based on the refurbishment, it does not warrant a 70 Euro increase and it's a real shame as it puts a nice little hotel in the unaffordable category for a lot of people who would previously have stayed here (a comment I made to the hotel).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Beyond 5 stars I am 57 years old and have travelled extensively and stayed in many beautiful hotels, but the Drake Hotel now sits at the top of my list.

Good hotel, good location Stayed here for a few on nights on way to Sydney in November 04. Like a lot of other reviewers, i thought the room was small but in a place like Hong Kong you shouldn't be spending too much time there. Staff were friendly and helpful and some good info from the tourist desk. About 10 minutes walk from the busy streets of Causeway Bay, but 30 seconds from the MTR station and trams which are cheap and reliable (buy an Octupus card at the airport!).Tremendous, mainly unrestricted views over Hong Kong, harbour and Kowloon from the rooftop pool. Restaraunt a bit pricey, but reasonable value European/Asian buffet breakfast. No problems at night with karoke - although Bridge Over Troubled Water in Cantonese is interesting.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'conflict']]

Travelled from the airport on the service bus ~ 鈧? per couple returned by Taxi ~ 鈧?25-30. Glass of carva on arrival and the breakfast was very good (if a little expensive).

The food in the italian restaurant was very good as we went with the nightly special.

great hotel just got back from a 1 night stay, the location of the hotel is fantastic just at the top of Las Ramblas. Hotel itself is spotless as were the rooms.

Discreet Charms Of The Neri On Tripadvisor comments I booked this hotel for a short 4 day break - we weren't disappointed. It is the perfect small hotel with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Having travelled extensively, far too many hotels rely upon offering a plethora of services that guests will never use. The Neri, in common with good hotels, simply concentrates on providing excellent accomodation where a good nights sleep is guaranteed, excellent assistance from the helpful staff, and a wonderful location for sightseeing. The hotel deserves to succeed.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Amazing hospitality! The young man who greeted us, Mozah, was very professional even though we arrived late. My wife was on crutches ( sprained knee just hrs before the flight) and even though we were there only for one night before our cruise and were given a room more accommodating for no extra charge! Very clean suite and would not hesitate to book for an extended stay as the location was close to everything! Two thumbs up for affordable accommodations. R.

Must have been in a different hotel than others Seeing all the rave reviews of this place, I must have been at another hotel, there is nothing decent in downtown NO, or its clientele is too young and/or drunk to know any better. Desk service is condescending, except for the sheets rooms are really not well-maintained, carpet is badly stained, and everything is worn-out. Good but noisy location with thin walls. Downstairs breakfast restaurant looks mediocre and expensive, though the night club looks intrguing. Would stay again only if stuck. Tip: Unless the season is very busy, you can probably get very deep discount coupons at Visitor Center, so don't reserve ahead.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

Kid Friendly in SF We stayed at the Argonaut last weekend for my cousin's wedding and were very impressed. The service was outstanding - both toward us and our 2 year old. We had a king sized room, which was fairly small, but well arranged, so we didn't feel cramped. The staff was very friendly and even brought our son a gold fish to take care of during his stay.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
problems in paradise I was travelling on a family gathering in Miami, and my family booked at this hotel previously. I arrived at 2230 on a Thursday and Friday morning enjoyed the breakfast they offered, subsequently we left the hotel around 1430 on Friday and returned at 1600, on return luggage from our room had been stolen. My major concern was the way in which the hotel handled this, the first question they asked was should we call the police? I also noted that on return at least 3 room doors were opened by housekeeping and the rooms unprotected by employees, thus violating their own policy - to get into this hotel you have to go through a gate into a secured compound. My warning is this: the hotel accomodations are nice and pleasant, be very careful about your possessions and use the safe!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Great hotel, great service I was impressed by all aspects of the Affinia 50. Sophistication without the attitude, which is so hard to find. When I was concerned about how to find a particular restaurant by cab, the person at the front desk found the restaurant in the NYC Zagat guide and made a copy of the listing for me. The service from the bell staff was equally terrific. I can't wait to return!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

The beds are the most comfortable ever, like a massive marshmallow! The breakfast is brilliant, with loads of choice, restaurant, amenities, staff all brilliant. Would recommend. Only downside I can think of is that as stated by others reviews, they do not provide much in the tea/coffee making kit, but the card said that you could have more if####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great small hotel in the old town There can't be many hotels on earth owned by such a fascinating man as this one. The rooms are all equipped not only with everything you need for a very comfortable (and affordable) stay, but also with copies of the owner's writings - thoughts, reflections and words of wisdom, a kind of cross between Khalil Gibran and Marcus Aurelius. He himself is an inspired and inspiring presence, and a stay in his wonderful, charmed hotel is capable of changing the course of a person's life. There are testimonies on the internet to this effect. It seems he will drop everything for a deep conversation with a guest. The hotel also has a wonderful rooftop bar and restaurant, which is great place to catch the evening light and eat excellent local gourmet food.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Loved the Halekulani Spent over a week at the Halekulani in February, what a wonderful hotel. Friendly staff, beautiful room and peaceful surroundings.

Great price and good location This motel has always been a favorite due to its location near Folsom Street and nightlife - but is even better now that its been given a AAA one-diamond rating and upgraded the rooms.

reviews are spot on excellent location - restauarants and bars are all on the street right in front of the hotel.sites very easily accesible with both the u bahn and s bahn right outside the door.we didnt have breakfast - its 15 euros but if book day before its 11. To be honest though, once you have found a place to eat, ordered juice, coffee and say crambled eggs you have pretty much spent that anyway so it is probably worth it as its a buffet.bar in hotel nice to start in or have a drink before bed.if you stay in the front of the hotel - the windows are transparent!we stayed with two children and hotel was fi####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

Out of the ordinary This is an unusual hotel, different from the normal run of the mill. I had a large and comfortable room, minimalist design which actually turned out to be quite relaxing! Its a few stops on the tram from the city, the road is reasonably quiet. The tram stop is close by, as is the canal hopper service.

My Birthday meal I havnt stayed at this hotel but while staying in Barcelona my wife took me to the Torres for a meal on my birthday. The views are astounding and we were given a table with excellent views of the Magic Fountains which started performing at 21.00 hrs and the show was spectacular. The food was excellent and the staff were extremely helpfull and also very knowledgeable about the menus, wine and food. I am a qualifed Chef and my wife and I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world including what is listed as THE best restaurant in the world at the moment by renowned Chefs, The Fat Duck in Bray, UK and found the food and service in The Torres to be of an extremely high standard.

Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed here at the end of September and the beginning of October for 9 nights. This hotel is good value for money, we booked a partial sea view room which was clean and tidy. The location of the hotel is great just across the road from the beach with plenty of reastaurants and shops nearby.

The Wonderful Watertown This was a wonderful experience. The staff couldn't be more helpful, the only problem is that they are going to burn themselves out if they keep going at this rate.

OK Location but noisy rooms Hotel Balmes looks very plush from outside and in the reception area, however we were in room 13 and it was very dark and also very noisy, didn't get too much sleep during our stay. Our room was spacious though and had a seating area as well as sleeping area and nice bathroom. The walk to Placa Catalunya was about 20 minutes I would say, which was further than I had originally thought, but it was easy to find our way around. Didn't have breakfasts at the hotel. Used the garden area, but not the pool although it did look very tempting, but the weather wasn't really warm enough.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Great location The hotel is very central and clean. However, on checking in, they told us our room was in another building across the road, which turned out to be another hotel but owned by Hotel Victoria 4.

Perpetual Guest We first found this hotel four years ago. Although the rooms are small, the privacy, ambience and staff more than make up for the lack of space.

I switched Hotels after one night I do a fair amount of business travel each year so I have developed a standard. This hotel has a very nice central interrior and the staff is extremely helpful. Maybe I got unlucky, but after switching rooms twice due to the smell of the room and other unatractive characteristics, I decided to leave the property all together. The hotel is located far from the french quarter which also contributed to my decision to switch. Although the bar is nice and the breakfast, the one day I did stay, was excellent, I've become accustomed to a higher standard and comfort from my room.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Mediocre cleaning, mediocre breakfast buffet Was not asked about room preference at check-in and got one stinking with old cigarettes. Happily we were offered a non-smoking room within 30 minutes after we complained. The glasses and cups we used in the room were not changed by the cleaning lady, just wiped off. The breakfast buffet was ok, but not up to the standards one should expect from a 4-star hotel.

Functional downtown hotel Stayed for 2 nights in July 06, a functional hotel located slightly away from downtown but within 10 minutes walk of most of the sights. I'd have this down as a 3 star rather than 2.5.Received a warm welcome on arrival, and we were able to check-in despite arriving early, lots of information offered by the reception staff and secure underground parking (for $16 per day).Room was clean but not huge. The receptionist advised that the hotel was going to be refurbished later in the year, but it had cable TV, air con and everything else you need when your planning to spend most of your time exploring a fantastic city like Seattle. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on the first day but it was over-priced and the food wasn't great. On the second day we chose to go to one of the many local coffee shops, which was much better and cheaper!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]

Elegant Hotel, excellent position, but some minor flaws We stayed here in late September 2003, and would recommend it for position, and its effortless elegance and style. A five minute walk from the Duomo and various excellent side-street restaurants make it a very strong choice. That said, those minor flaws: as in other hotels, rooms vary in quality from tired and jaded to newly refurbished with Tuscan pain effects - so negotiate for the better ones. Breakfast was mediocre with catering being run by an outside conmtractor! Be prepared to part with $25 a day for parking as well. But overall the setting- especially the roof-top bar terrace - gave this a very strong rating.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Vibe Hotel and I thought, for price and location, you can't beat it. They had just recently undergone a massive renovation and the rooms were modern and comfortable and included any amenity we could have asked for -- minus complimentary towels at the rooftop pool which was slightly annoying since we called down to housekeeping 3 times and were clearly ignored. So basically, aside from lack of towels at the pool, out stay was comfortable and hassle free and exactly what we were looking for.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

My only problem is that they toast the buns to their burgers, and it's a little crunchy on the outer edge, which I don't like. Otherwise, it was a nice night for me.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Very centrally located We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and were very pleased with our choice. The hotel was less than a 5-minute walk from the Shinjuku Station and close to everything (shops, restaurants, etc). Although the rooms were a bit tiny as are all Tokyo hotel rooms I was told, they were very clean. The lobby was nicely designed with modern decor; very stylish and chic. Overall, we had a wonderful time staying at the Sunroute Plaza.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Fantastic Kapok - loved it! We loved the Kapok so much we stayed there 3 times over a 3 week period while coming and going from Beijing! It is in a fabulous location, is modern and funky, has a great bar and restaurants and fantastic staff. Added to this was the excellent price. We'll definitely go back.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
The quiet jewel in the quarter Was apprehensive about staying in the French Quarter with the sounds of a party echoing from Bourbon Street. But found this small hotel, only 1/2 block off of Bourbon, to be a quiet jewel. With a good hotels amenities and a friendly and helpful staff, I found myself able to complete my buisness and enjoy some of the nightlife made famous by Bourbon Street. I highly recommend the Hotel Saint Marie for buisness or pleasure.####[['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative']]
Super Stayed for three nights on business. It is just super. Great room. Great view and good location. I would definately stay here again if I had to return to Singapore on business.

Highly recommend the Berchielli We spent 2 nights at the Berchielli last week, and the experience was completely delightful: perfect location (on the river, an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio); friendly, attentive staff; spotless, attractive rooms; and an excellent (hot) American breakfast. Other family members had spectacular river views through 2 huge windows in their rooms. My single room, which I referred to as the princess room, since you went up 2 flights of stairs to enter the sleeping/bath area after you came in the door, had no view, but was so delightfully quiet that I happily accepted the trade-off. The size of the hotel was perfect, with a boutique atmosphere. I loved Florence, and will hope to have the opportunity to return and enjoy the Berchielli again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
New Cliff Vilas best in Bali We spent seven nights there over Easter and stayed in the new Cliff Vilas. For under $US600 a night incl breakfast, it was extraordinary value for money. The vilas are the size of a house, with a large and magnificent private pool, cabana, grounds, living room and bathroom that is equal in size to half the vila. You see the ocean from every room, the butler was great and whilst the staff were not the most efficent in the world, their efforts and kindness make up for it. 10 out of 10.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Above Average Hotel Stayed for three nights in June 2005. Slightly overrated. While the rooms were clean and modern (plasma t.v., purified water in the bathroom), they are very small. Hotel guests are mostly white Americans, not that that is a bad thing but being in the hotel, you would never know you were in China (except for the staff). Great location, excellent service, clean/modern facilities, good Western-style restuarant for buffet breakfast, luxury shopping within the hotel.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Excellent Not much more to say. I'm pretty picky about hotels but this a great place in every way. I agree with the last reviewer about not wanting too many people to find out about this place.

Ideal hotel We really liked this hotel, we were originally booked for the Kempinsky but due to a mix up we couldn't get in, and booked this very much last minute. The hotel is a little tired however they are working on that and it will be rectified, the breakfast was wonderful with lots of choice. All in all we would definitely stay here again. If you are going to Berlin for a few days and know how to ride a pushbike we would strongly recommend the fat tire bike company, nothing too strenuous, but a great way of seeing the city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
single room double price I had booked a double room through a website, then I called to check if there was a single available as I was going to be on my own. They said fine, no problem, but don't bother to cancel the original booking. We'll take care of it when you arrive. When I got there I was given a very small room with just ONE single bed, so I expected a single room rate as well. But when I checked out I realized that was not the case. Single room, double price.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]

Sweeping city views This is a great new hotel in San Francisco close to the Convention Centre and the main shopping area. I had the luxury of staying in one of the well appointed junior suites. These are located on the corners of the building so the room has huge floor to ceiling windows on two sides (also extending into the bathroom).The room was huge, complete with iPod docking station, huge flat screen TV and a massive bathroom with a walk-in double shower at one end. All the staff were courteous, especially the cheerful spa staff and my three night stay was very pleasant.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
AMAZING EXPERIENCE This is one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. A beautiful new hotel building, wonderful one bedroom suite, stunning views from our room and the VIP lounge, and excellent service.

atedral lives up to its reputation! We have stayed at Hotel Catedral for the past 16 years whenever we go to Mexico City for business or pleasure. The staff knows us and we always get excellent service and treatment. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the restaurant is fantastic. It may not be a luxury property, but with the money we save we can eat at the most expensive restaurants around and thoroughly enjoy ourselves.

Good value for New York Stayed for 6 nights from the 9th January. Had to wait till 4pm for room(official check in time 3pm)The offer of a complimentary drink or pot of tea would have been nice but not offered. Room was big by NY standards and best view over NY I've had in 6 stays in the city. Very central for all attractions and the staff helpful and efficient. Very surprised nobody has mentioned the Westway diner on 9th Avenue between 41st and 42nd street as a great place for breakfast-or for that matter any meal-they're open 24/7.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
ice city shame about the hotel we stayed for 1 week in August 4-11th,2008, found hotel to be showing its age ,Doormen and staff very polite and courteous. But as a show Hotel for Boston ,I think it could do with some updating. As some people have said it is surrounded by some good buildings ,such as Trinity church and the Library,but is overshadowed by the monster skyscraper of the Hancock tower. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends or family as I believe more modern hotels exist in the city. What I can say is we experienced some history that the hotel showed in its makeup.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'neutral']]
Highly Recommend Victoria 4 Victoria 4 is well located, near Plaza de Sol, about half-way between the Prado and the Royal Palace, and a short walk to the Gran Via. There are many restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. The hotel staff was helpful, the room sufficiently large, clean and quiet. The lobby is somewhat small. The breakfast, which was included, was more than satisfactory for a continental breakfast.

Prescott - A lifesaver THe Prescott came to my aid after I left another hotel around the block which could n't provide high speed access. They set me up with a wireless bridge which worked perfectly with my laptop. I had no problem with cell phone reception in my room and probaly made 50 calls at the time. THe only reason I didn't give this lovely hotel excellent is due to the limited room service. It is difficult to find a place in the neighbourhood to get a reasonably priced meal - you don't want $30.00 entrees every night.####[['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great Atmosphere If you are looking for something at little out of the ordinary stay at the hotel Zaza. Everything about the place is unique.

weekend at the westin this is a very nice hotel in a very good location in downtown dallas.the beds were soft.the shower was a heavenly shower with very good water pressure.the towels were very thick and soft.no pool.the only bad thing about this hotel is that it is connected to the plaza of the americas office complex which is closed on the weekends.so all of the shops are not open.there is an ice skating rink that is open for limited skating.pay the $20 for valet parking unless you plan to drive to other parts of dallas.the dart train is only about 2 blocks from the front door.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
no problem with me I hesitated to book a room in this hotel because of the mixed opinions posted below, but I went on to reserve one mainly because of its location (undoubtedly the closest hotel from the central station).

Excellent I stayed there with a mate having arrived after 15hrs on planes from New York, Madrid and Barcelona. The staff were friendly and welcoming right from the start, with plenty of charm and good humour (which we found unusual in Spain on the whole)! Rooms were very clean and well maintained. It's in a great location for the night-life (ramblas) and was within easy walking distance of good bars, resturants, and other attractions. I'lld recomend this mainly for younger people, singles or couples as the nightlife in the immediate area is vibrant to say the least.

I liked the Mosser The Mosser is a very clean, comfortable, friendly, attractive hotel that's in a great location in San Francisco. It's also inexpensive. The only drawbacks - which are no secret - are that the rooms are small (although very well arranged) and the bathrooms are shared (or at least mine was).

From the elevator completely covered in pages from old books, the complimentary Aveda shampoo (my fiancee was particularly fond of this), timely valet service, and exemplary service, staying at Hotel Rex made our stay in SF a flawless experience.

Nice Hotel Nice hotel to stay while on a girls getaway. Located just outside the French Quarter. It was a clean hotel, nicely decorated, however the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small, so if your traveling with 4-5 women you may want a larger room. It was about a 10 minute walk from the Quarter, which is not bad, but it was a bit scary at 2 in the morning. Quaint bar. For the great rate they charge it is worth staying.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Did not love the Chealsea Lodge First of all, I rely on Trip Advisor for my traveling. The room that I stayed in was horribly small. The TV didn't get great reception, the shower kept going from scalding to freezing, and there was a huge pipe in the room that kept whistling like a tea kettle. The cleaning staff was very friendly. However, when we explained to the problem with our room (whistling pipe), they were not willing to accommodate us at all.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Area surrounding hotel is unsavory - please read my review Myself and five female friends stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years. In the square in front of the hotel we were attacked and the men hanging around the square made many violent attempts to steal our handbags. The night manager of the desk witnessed this happening, did nothing and kept the front glass doors locked until we banged on them, begging to be let in. The night manager would do nothing to ensure our safety and we got a typical mediterean shrug when we asked him to notify authorities, as two other women were attacked in the square while we were at the desk. Barcelona is a big city with big city problems but the treatment of the staff and proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona mean that this hotel should be avoided.####[['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Loved it! My husband whisked me away to New York City for my Christmas present, needless to say I was blown away by the city and the hotel.

Lovely hosts, but catered towards Americans The hotel is quaint with a lovely terrace and nice hosts, but seemed as if this place was more geared towards americans, with some surprise at guests that are not americans (i.e. us). This is probably due to the american wife of the owner couple. Unfortunately this made the hotel seem less diverse, whereas Florence is very diverse!!The rooms are large, but some features such as bathrooms do need updating. Breakfast is not included, which is a shame as many hotels in Italy offer it.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Totally ok I spent there 3 nights in the begining of May, nice hotel, just few block uphill to famous Lombard street, the same walking distance to Fisherman Wharf rooms were cleaned, front staff very polite and helpful.

Friendly, helpful staff The best part of Casci is the staff. They were very helpful with recommendations- directions, restaurants, etc. This was our second hotel in Florence, and compared to the first, Casci had a little more of a hostel kind of feel- signs in the bathroom asking you not to clean your laundry in the sink, for example. This was the quietest of all hotels we stayed at, which was nice. The location was great- down the street from the Duomo, street markets, and within walking distance of the train station.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
It's All True! We stayed here just one night during a week-long stay in the Chianti area, and the member raves are quite well deserved. The hotel is extremely well situated; the owners/staff could not have been nicer or more patient and accommodating; the rooms were immaculate, and ours was of quite decent size. We didn't take the breakfast, but heard from our friends that it was lovely. We would absolutely recommend Hotel Casci to all of our family and friends traveling to Florence, and we hope to come back soon ourselves.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Great Resort Despite the coldest weekend in 16 years, we had a FABULOUS time at the JW Desert Ridge and barely realized that it was raining and even SNOWING in AZ! The JW did a wonderful job with service and addressing every need we had, and we were impressed from the valet attendant to the bellman to the room service! The grounds were beautiful and well maintained, and there were significant challenges given the temperature changes there. Truly a wonderful experience and would recommend this resort to anyone...that I like!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
Loved Tepi Sawah Tepi Sawah is a beautiful and tranquil boutique hotel just outside Ubud centre. The room and bathroom faces pretty rice fields and the volcano. The hotel shuttle provides transport to Ubud centre and back at your convenience. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

Luxury with a smile A touch of luxury but delivered with good humour and without the 'stuffiness' you might expect from such a renowned hotel group. Great location in one of the prettiest parts of Amsterdam, surrounded by excellent restaurants and bars. The room was spacious and beautifully furnished.

Excellent hotel but can get expensive Hotel was clean and service was excellent. Restaurants in the motel are expensive so go out to eat. Hotel is classy with a beautiful lobby and front desk area. Beach area is shared with other hotels so it can crowded early. We do not recommend the dinner cruises, they are over rated and over priced, do a luai instead. Hotel is recommended and if you get room 1609 you will have a good ocean view without paying for it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Perfect Location... Fun Hotel Just returned from a two-night stay at the Triton, and I have to say my experience was in contrast to that of some of the other reviewers who felt there was a lack of restaurants in the neighborhood or that the staff wasn't helpful enough. We received excellent recommendations for dining in the neighborhood (Taylor St., Ryoko and Le Colonial) both nights of our stay from helpful concierge, Nick. Add to that a perfect location -- practically in Chinatown, right next to Union Square, and convenient to the waterfront--and a fun decor. It's true that some facilities could use better upkeep (e.g., plumbing), but for the price, I would go back to Triton again in a heartbeat.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Great Vacation!! My friends and I spent a week at the Marriott in San Juan and we loved it!! We enjoyed the beach and the hotel itself and had tons of fun! It was near everthing and the best part was it was between Old San Juan and Isla Verde (which are two great places to visit). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
There are better choices I stayed at the Shinjuku Washington, hoping to save a bit of money on a trip to Tokyo. The hotel lobby was in a chaotic state and the staff were not particularly helpful or courteous. My room was clean, but truly tiny and in need of refurbishment. I had to pay extra to leave my luggage for a couple hours after check-out. I would prefer spending more for a nicer hotel, such as the Century Southern Tower in the same area or the Mercure Ginza.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
very good value We visited Berlin in June 2004 and found the hotel very clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were larger than expected and great value for money. The hotel was within walking distance of Alexanderplatz where there is a very efficient metro system serving most areas of Berlin. In the evenings we visited some bars within walking distance of the hotel but admittedly hard to find which were open very late. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
100% Happy. Was very sad to leave! Great views of the harbour/city, great service, great hotel, great room, great food, great bar, great facilities, great location, clean, comfortable, modern and the staff were always as helpful as they could be. It felt like a 5 star hotel but without a 5 star price. When I go back to HK assuming the prices are the same or similar I will definately stay there next time.

Nice hotel- good location This is a very nice hotel in a great central location. Staff were friendly and it was clean and well maintained.

Great amenities for the price If you want a first class or corporate hotel in a nondescript cityscape, then stay away from the Perak, instead book at one of the glass and concrete boxes on Orchard Road. The Perak is not like the big chain hotels but is a great value for the money in Singapore. For around $70USD per night you get a clean (albiet small) room, with basic but nice appointments(Cable TV, A/C, DVD, free wireless internet, etc), a good location in vibrant Little India, and basic but tasty buffet breakfast. I had no complaints other than a bit of street noise late at night when a neaby bar was closing up. But the cheapest rooms at the Perak have a skylight rather than a window and are much quieter if noise is an issu####[['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Great Views, Great Hotel I had the pleasure of staying here for a few days and must say that this is one of the better hotels in the country. I was in room 3905 which had a great view of the golden gate bridge in the background. Staff can't do enough for you, they always call you by name. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant Silks, but everything else in the hotel is top notch. They had a good rate of $395 a night for a room which normally sells for $610 a night.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Excellent value I stayed in the hotel from 23-24 December. An excellent stay, nice spa, good food, very friendly staff and quite affordable. Check all the websites for offers, the prices I found varied 40 EUR per night. The hotel is in a quiet zone in the centre of Berlin, 15 min. walk to Potsdammer Platz with e.g. the Neue Nationalgalerie and a 15 min. walk to the Ged盲chtniskirche.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

harming, quaint hotel in central SF location If you're looking to stay at a very charming, quaint hotel, then try Laurel Inn. The lobby and sitting area are comfortable, and the rooms are simply furnished and looked retro. There was nothing pretentious about the staff or the services.

a warm and intimate hotel in a big city We recently spent a long weekend at The Benjamin. I have to agree with all the previous positive posts.

Location, location, location This is just a very quick review - I take from this site so think if is only fair to give back something, even if it is only very brief. On the basis of the reviews on this site we booked the Alicia and were not disappointed in the least. I'm a fussy devil, and where possible do like to stay in 4* hotels, but I could not find fault with this hotel other than there was no tea-making facilities in the room. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
Loved our Spaulding Hotel Very good location, centrally located close to Theaters and shopping. We were given a nice quiet room on the 6th floor overllooking the pool of the adjacent hotel property. We traveled with our teenage daughter who enjoyed being close to the hip boutiques such as HM, Urban Ourfitter and Forever 21. The room had hard wood floors and was clean and cosy. The lounge on the second floor was really convenient and had washers and dryers which was super.

Great Location, Great Staff, Rooms a little Small (but hey, it's Paris) The location was great (facing the Pantheon, close to the Metro) and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We'll stay again nexy time we're in Paris. The only minor negative is that the rooms are awfully small (huge beds make it even worse). You can pay more and get larger rooms so that may be a good option.

Multiple Great Stays For the 3rd time in recent months stayed at the Sheraton Metro Center, off Dunlap Ave and the Black Canyon Freeway (I-17 N).

great location, design hotel A lovely modern hotel in a great location, on a wide, very smart shopping boulevard in the centre. Also about 30 seconds from the (underground) train station to the airport (25 mins).Apart from the usual complaints about working the lights/blinds, and flooding the bathroom with the shower, we really enjoyed the room and our stay. Booked through the hotel website which gave us a free breakfast.

Bad hotel, good location This is clearly not a 3 star hotel ! The staff is rather unpleasant, decoration is inexistant, rooms are tiny and beds are too soft, no air conditioning in the rooms which are just under the rooftop, and to finish breakfast is mediocre (no croissants or pancakes only bread, no choice in fruit juices etc...). The only good point is its location right on the Dam place.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative']]

I arrived after a difficult trip from Milan to the comfort, luxury and top flight airconditioning of the hotel Gallery Art (an essential in the middle of August).In contrast to other Italian hotels I experienced, the staff were consistently delightful and superbly helpful at all times.

Brilliant hotel I spent two nights at Calzaiuoli at the end of last month and can't fault it. It's location is superb and although I was worried it would be noisy because it's so central, we weren't disturbed all night. The breakfast is exactly what you expect and perfectly good with lots of hot, strong coffee. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Florence and this one is definitely up there with my favourite, the Antica Torre, but this one is definitely more affordable.

Lovely My friends and I stayed here for four nights over the St Patricks day period. Our rooms were on the 36th floor, really nice rooms, very clean and modern, maid service every day. The only thing I would fault would be, some of the reception staff are quite rude, and keep an eye on your bill with the bar staff, if they are serving at your table, keep tabs of what you had as they do seem to try to add drinks on that you haven't had, or imply you haven't paid! This also happened to another couple who were staying there the same time as us!Apart from that, good location and a lovely hotel, would stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

expensive for what it gives It's not really bad, but does not give value for money. When arriving at SFO airport, I called the shuttle line and was told that it would take about 10-12 minutes.

Good value, Good location Booked a two night stay including breakfast both days and evening meal on first night for 拢179.Evening meal was absolutely awful, supposedly nouveau cuisine but simply an excuse to serve minute portions of tasteless food. However everything else was great and in contrast to the evening meal, the buffet breakfast was fantastic.

mfortable, Clean,  Stayed at the Ohana West from 1/22-1/29/05, was pleasantly surprised after reading many mixed reviews. We had a city/mountain view, king room, on the 16th floor with a nice size lanai, the room was a little small, but clean and comfortable. The daily housekeeping service was very prompt and did a very good job, and all the staff at the hotel demonstrated excellent customer service. The location of this hotel is perfect, it is centrally located to all the great things to do in Oahu. If your looking for a 5 star hotel this is not the place, but if your looking for a nice place with reasonable rates and great service, then this is the place to stay.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

ice hotel We had a beautiful room, very big, with a comfortable bed and a huge bathroom, But this is an old hotel, dated. I found it not very clean, the carpets were dirty and also the restaurant was like that (and food was not so good...). I didn't like all that cement, gray walls. Anyway, people working there were nice, we arrived late at night but they allowed us to have dinner even if the restaurant was already closed, and they gave us a lot of information: very nice and polite. I think it is a good hotel if you have children (the pool is very big), but it is too much expensive for the quality of the building.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Great small hotel Spent a week at the Hotel de londres eiffel. English speaking staff. Clean rooms but small. No restaurant but plenty others close at hand. If you are not looking for luxury and want to experience the local atmosphere I would recommend this hotel. A bonus is that it is 3 blocks from the Eiffel Tower.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
>A perfect beginning A fantastic location providing excellent value for money. For 拢50 a night in central san francisco this hotel is certainly a find. The continental breakfast is a good start to the day including waffles, breakfast croisants, cereal, toast and huge muffins. The hotel is two minutes from union square and close to both Powell Mason  Hyde and California cable car lines. My only criticism is that the rooms are a little small and you can find yourself falling over your bags.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Paper Thin Walls You know it's bad when you sneeze and the people in the next room bless you (actually happened). We could hear the lightest of sounds from both of our neighbors, and they weren't loud people. I can't ever imagine staying here again; it's the biggest lack of privacy I have ever experienced in a hotel.####[['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Unfair Due to loss of my credit card on holiday, I could not show the card used for payment of the room. The staff were very unhelpful, and proceeded to charge for the room but refused to let us stay despite proof of ID. Waste of 拢73. We had to make our way to the airpost and stay there for the evening as it was too late to go anywhere else.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Overall good For the price and location you can't do better. The staff is very friendly, you are 30 seconds away from the beach on foot, and 30 seconds away from buses to the airport or old San Juan. Isla Verde (where the hotel is) is a safe touristy place but, of course, old San Juan is far more picturesque -- and far more expensive... Make sure to eat at PLATOS, the hotel's restaurant: some of the best food I had in Puerto Rico and, again, very reasonably priced.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Very comfortable and clean hotel with a great breakfast buffet We arrived direct from the airport and recieved excellent service from the very start. The twin room we had was very spacious and had a very useful small kitchenette, with microwave, dishwasher and small stoveThe breakfast buffet was very busy with a long que, but worth the wait and had a good selection.

Will not stay here again! While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham, WA to San Diego, CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Seattle Quality Inn  Suites. Yes, the hotel was within walking distance of the Space Needle. However, when I requested a 2pm check-out (we did not check-in until after 7pm) as per the special services extended to Choice Privileges members, I was told the latest we could check-out was 1pm; the room was small; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed; only one elevator worked and it was slow; the complimentary in room coffee service was provide only for one person; after showering, the bathtub took forever to drain (over 8 minutes) and left behind scum; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room; the business center computer was out of order; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Loved It... We got an excellent rate online which included breakfast (a must!) We could not have been more pleased with the hotel and staff.

Best hotel in in Oahu We had a fantastic holiday in the Hawaiian Prince last month. The staff were very helpful and friendly and I would like to give a special mention to Brenda who made our stay very special for my husband 50th birthday (upgraded us to a beautiful room with a fantastic view) . Also a special mention to Linda who worked in the pool area and was always helpful and attentive.

Great value, huge rooms This property isn't the nicest or the best location, but the rooms are huge and clean. I stay here for business a lot and can really spread out, like having an apartment while I'm away from home. The staff isn't the best, but friendly and accomodating. If you are going to the convention center, this is one block away. If you're leisure traveling, there are other great places to stay in the same rate level with more character, but for extended trips it can't be beat for the price and comfort.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'neutral'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

Magnificent Oasis of peace in the middle of the bustle of Mongkok. Superb hotel with all the expected facilities at a good value price. Our 25th floor Executive Room was spacious, clean  comfortable.

recommended by a friend We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008. A friend had recommended the Queen based on a stay from several years before. Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia. We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there. The beach was within easy walking distance.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Superb hotel, great staff, fab location Just returned from a 3 night stay in Barcelona with my mum. Booked this hotel after reading good reviews on this website and it did not disappoint. The location is fantastic, lots of great sights within walking distance and no matter where we wanted to go, it cost us less than 5 euro's in a taxi. The staff were very friendly and took time to point us in the right direction for the sights we wanted to visit and also recommended and booked restaurants for us free of charge. Our room was very comfortable, they remembered to not give me feather pillows and the free minibar was a lovely touch.

Seattle's Best! Arrived very late in the evening for a one night stay. Staff were very solicitous, and on par with the hotel's service standards, each request was met with of course. All staff were pleasant, rooms were comfortably furnished with the latest innovations in guest room design, baths were wonderful. Even for a one night stay, this property was the best I've experienced in Seattle.

Rude and disorganized staff Arrived from a very long flight with my husband and 3 yr old toddler. The initial receptionist was very pleasant and checked us in without any problems as everything was in order with the room number already printed on the reservation slip at the front desk. After settling in and resting for about 2 hrs, we received a shock of our lives when someone tried to open the front door of our apartment but failed then we got a call from the front desk. The Manager (some guy) had the gull to ask us to move out to another room as the room is meant reserved for someone else and said the earlier staff that checked us in was new. So what if old or new staff, this is not the way to treat guests and not even an apology was given for their mistake! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Wonderful Visited for 3 days in March 2006 for our sons 21st birthday, What a great City and an even greater hotel !! We looked on Trip Advisor prior to going and the Savoy was highly recommended, we were not disappointed. Situated in the Plazza Della Republica with great views this is a beautiful hotel with great rooms great restaurants and some of the best trained staff we have ever come across, the service was second to none and the manager should be proud of him/herself. The location is great with all the attractions of Florence within easy walking distance. Our rooms were at the front directly overlooking the Plzza Della Republica, it was amazing , we could look out and listen to music playing every night, from violins, to salsa, opera and the atmosphere was electric - Cant wait to go back !!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Lovely hotel I stayed at the Adolphus for 3 days in April 2007. I was impressed with the hotel overall. Many hotels claim to be 'historic' but really thats just a cover up for being a bit old and lacking in services, not so with the Adolphus!The Adolphus was great, room was big, and good value for money considering its location and the standard of the furnishings.

Shabby is definitely the word Checked into the Sheraton and asked specifically for a room NOT overlooking the construction. Got a room overlooking just that. Ripped curtains, dirty carpet (from construction dust). This property is not run by Sheraton, just under their umbrella. For the price charged, I would NOT recommend staying there. Perhaps Sheraton should review some of the hotels they license to outside owners.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative']]
Great hotel in a very convenient location I really enjoyed my stay at the Abba Sants hotel. It is very comfortable, modern hotel. It's location, a few minutes walk from the Sants train station, is very convenient for travelers who are visiting the city. The hotel staff was great about giving restaurant recommendations that locals actually go to. The only downside was that the rooms were uncomfortably warm and the only way to cool down was to open the window which unfortunately let in the noise from a very busy street.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Good Value and Location Spent 3 nights ($110 per night) at the Ilima in Dec 2005. Very happy with the proximity to Waikiki Beach and the surrounding designer boutiques (Gucci, Chanel, Prada, etc.) and restaurants. This is not a 4 or 5 star establishment, but that is OK, since you are not paying prime $$$. The rooms are outdated, but clean, comfortable, and roomy. We found the staff to be friendly. If you are looking to save money and be within walking distance to all the action on Waikiki, then stay at the Ilima.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
ral location with friendly atmosphere. We stayed here early October and even though we had done our homework on location, were pleasantly pleased with the hotels location. In the heart of the city, just a few steps away from Chinatown and easy access to the two cable car lines or street cars, to give you quick tranportation to the main attraction areas. Ok there is street noise but then again you are in the centre of a city and the lift can be heard but not enough to disturb you. Our room was on the ninth floor and the view from the window overlooking the roof tops was lovely, the bathroom was very modern, and it was handy to have a safe deposit box in you room at no extra charge. We found the hotel recepitionists all to be very helpful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great place to stay Stopped for three days on the way to NZ, and enjoyed immensely. Room pretty good although can get a bit noisy outside, saying that my 5 year old slept perfectly. The reason for 5 is partly for location but mainly for the excellent staff, for example we arrived and I had lost the suitcase keys. the desk guy managed to find a saw and had freed up our possesions before I returned with (superb) coffees from opposite 7-11. Nothing seems to be too much trouble. Will certainly stay again on next trip over to NZ####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Not what I expected unfortunately. After booking in for business travel I was given a small rooom with barely enough space to walk around the queen size bed. Not very luxurious with regular TV etc (no flat sceen), and no view from the 6th floor. I requested a better room and was given a room on the top floor right next to the elevators, which were noisy and disturbed my sleep. After requesting a room change again I was given another average room by front desk staff who seem reluctant to help. As far as deluxe hotels go this place is really quite average - I think there are many better 5* hotels out there.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

The restaurant is rated highly by a number of gourment magazines and rooms are pleasant if on the small side. However the front desk staff have no interest in helping customers outside of routine check in and check out. Service is more akin to a 1 star hotel. I would rate the hotel 4 stars for location and 1 star for servic####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
gotta love the gym Other reviews have covered the room, the food etc. I want to add that the hilton has the best health club I have come across on my business trips. The latest in exercise machines, good selection of free weights and best of all, access to group fitness classes. This alone makes this hotel worth a return visit.####[['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
xcellent hotel Returned yesterday from a few days at this hotel. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are kept spotless. The food and drink on offer are both good value and of a good standard. The hotel is fairly central with a metro station outside the front door. A good choice hotel for anyone who likes quality at an affordable price.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Problems with Website I have not stayed at the hotel, but did make an online reservation through the hotel's official website. This has proven impossible to cancel online. The hotels cancellation web-page is non-responsive and my hotel-issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box. I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer's comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e-mailed his cancellation. Obviously this hotel has problems.####[['hotel general', 'negative']]
great experience Just returned from a group program. Overall, we had a great time.. Rooms were excellent, service friendly, pools beautiful. Food was average and can be improved for a 5 star resort.

Superb Hotel We are going to The Swissotel again in November this year, it will be the third year we have stayed there.

Great Location, Great Staff We stayed a week at the JW. Perfect location- walked to restaurants, aquarium, casino. Staff was wonderful-especially Gwendalyn.

Quality hotel at reasonable prices - recommended I stayed in the hotel on the first weekend in February with friends who were celebrating a wedding. Found the hootel to be spotlessly clean, convenient for the underground and most of the sites, the staff were very friendly and all spoke good English. I only ate there at breakfast, but this was excellent with lots of choice and good serving times. The bar was lively in the evening and the barmen were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The receptionists also helped to locate traditional German food and everyone enjoyed the hospitality of our hosts. It was my first visit to Berlin, but I will definitely be going again and will stay at the Movenpick.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Great little hotel We really enjoyed our stay at the Luna and Simone! The staff was friendly, the room was small but cute, cozy and clean and the perfect amount of space for the two of us, the breakfast was delicious and an awesome start to the day:) The hotel is within walking distance to everything and if you don't want to walk the bus stops right outside the door or Victoria tube station is just a bit of a walk up the road! We would definitely go back and highly recommend for anyone travelling to London!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
>Sold me out. Well, we never actually stood at this hotel. We did have a reservation, but did not stay. The one bedroom suite we reserved was not available and the standard room that manager offered us to crash in (it was about 11pm as we arrived) was so dirty and filthy that we just left.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Some Trick photography in the advertising The main saving graces of this hotel are the helpful and friendly staff and the fact the windows open to let the smell out!! I burst out laughing when I saw the gym, it is a converted closet and is so small the treadmill has to be put on an angle to fit. I've had two broken TV sets in a row (Maybe a rock band stayed there before me).####[['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Fantastic! Our family stayed here for a wedding and had an absolutely wonderful time. We occupied 5 rooms and after the first day the staff knew us  helped us with all kinds of things.

Just like they said... The Jazz was just as I had expected it to be. The hotel was nice to look at, there was a rumble from the underground, the rooms were clean and looked as they did in pictures, and it truly is very close to La Ramblas.

Very bad place We stayed at the hotel in two days from the 12of dec. to the 14of dec. 2008. The hotel are run down, the room are smelly and dirty, and the staff are not very helpfully at all. Eating breakfast at the hotel is expencive and you are still hungry after, because of the very small portions. We where gratefull that we only had to spent two days there, before going to Miami port for a seven days cruise with the beautifull ship Freedom of the Seas. Never again the Marseilles Hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Not recommended The room was disappointing. The furniture was very scuffed, and the walls had some stains. The staff was somewhat friendly, but more better looking than actually helpful. The exception was the valets, who were consistently doing a great job. For the money, better accomodation can be found in Seattle.####[['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Great find in a beautiful city Stayed at this gem of a place over the christmas weekend and really enjoyed it. The location was very good, in the Southern Canal Belt which was close enough to all the major attractions without feeling too touristy, and the tram links were frequent and convenient. After reading the previous reviews was actually prepared for a small closet room but the bedroom was pleasantly spacious and definitely one of the bigger ones I've seen in Europe. The complimentary minibar was a nice finishing touch, and the Living Room reception area, with a cheery fire and free flow of drinks and snacks, was a lifesaver for those cold Amsterdam afternoons.. All in all, a great place and would not hesitate in recommending to any####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Great Location! For those who've never been to San Francisco, The Tuscan Inn (near Fisherman's Wharf) is the perfect first. We were near all the transportation modes (and there are plenty), shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Our room was large and comfortable, and the staff was top-notch (especially Elmer). If you have a question, they have the answer or will get it for you. We were very pleased with The Tuscan Inn.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Is that Rooms? I was one day at Kowloon Hotel, but I am wondering is it possibile to call that room  an hotel room. I was alone and even if I am not too fat, the space was exactly for me. Ok, room in HKG are very small but this seems too small, otherwise concierge service was good and location is ok for Kowloon nad Nathan Road.considering all and what i have paied I can say this hotel is on everage quality and I will return only If I could be able to find a very... very... good price... otherwise not!!!####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['hotel quality', 'neutral']]

Wonderful exterior but damp  The Fullerton is in a fantastic location - especially if you are doing business in Singapore. And it looks great from the outside. But the rooms can be very damp and musty - and I've stayed in this hotel on about 8 separate occasions now.... Plus worst of all is that sometimes in the middle of the night I've been woken up by extremely loud airconditioning noises. Not acceptable in a 5 star hotelIf in Singapore and looking for a decent hotel I'd recommend 4 Seasons or Raffles The Plaza as better hotels for similar or lower price.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
Excellent Service Spot. If you need a comfortable place to crash after a hectic day of sightseeing, this is the place.

Fantastic!! Stayed here from May 16-23. The hotel is ideally located in the Fashion District of the city and all the shopping you can imagine in only minutes away. The doormen are exceptionally friendly and hospitable, and are extremely knowledgable regading tourist must-sees. The California room was wonderful; with a huge bathroom which included a shower and soaking tub.

The Silla is fabulous and so reasonable Brilliant, quiet, family run, view over Arno, 5 mins walk from ponte vecchio - ask for room 23 or equivalent - aircond is whisper quiet but enough to mask traffic and partner's snoring. Recent refurbish is good though ensuite is small - who cares the shower works well. Lovely terrace for breakfast or drinks - minibar in room will take your duty free, but no tea making equipment (only minus point).

Excellent value for money We stayed in this hotel from 29th Dec to 1st January. The hotel is small and the staff are very friendly. The room we stayed in was larger than we expected and was extremely clean and comfortable. As other people have stated, the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy walking distance to other livelier areas of the city. It is also a short walk to the nearest metro station. Considering what some of the other hotels were charging in Paris, I would consider this hotel to be excellent value for money.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great location, fun district and nearby a major subway/train station We usually stay at the Peninsula when in Tokyo for business, but a Japanese colleague recommened the Cerulean. The location was great, walking distance to the side-streets of Shibuya and the Shibuya train station which has connections to many of the major tourist sights. The hotel itself was adequate and clean. Service was good, but still not compable to five star hotels like the Peninsula or Four Seasons. A friend mentioned the Italian restaurant there was good, but we didn't have the chance to try it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great hotel Fantastic hotel as you will have seen from the other reviews. Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed and the duck by the bath. Very central for business travellers and there is an MTR station below the hotel in Pacific Place, a massive shopping centre but not cheap!The only slightly negative thing I could say about the hotel is to do with the swimming pool location. The hotel is next to the Shangri-la hotel and in the afternoon the Shangri-la blocks the sun from the pool. Other than that the place is faultless.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'negative']]

Great Place to Destress..... Just returned from 3 nights at the Maya Ubud which was absolute heaven. We stayed in the superior garden villa - and the only sound to be heard was the birds and the occasional thwack of a tennis ball. The Spa is situated in a great location and the elevator ride down to reach the infinity pool and facilities is a great way to avoid the steps! We both had the 75 minute massages and it was so tranquil to only hear the sound of the river flowing below and the odd frog!The amenities around the hotel were excellent and we ate in most of the restaurants and found the service and food to be fantastic. We also did the nature walk with a guide and enjoyed going through the villages and walking through a rice paddy. All in all a great place to stay if you want to have peace and quiet but be close to main centre (5/8 minutes away)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Spot On Not one to write these types of reviews generally but would liketo leave a few comments on the Hotel D'Albe ( Rue De La Harpe ) as accommodation in city centres can often be hit and miss. Went with my wife and my parents for short break via Eurostar to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday and can only say experience was superb. Staff were very helpful with all travel ,restaurant and river cruise bookings - as said location ideal,premises were very clean and would definitely recommend to any friends/family in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]

a true oasis I stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and previously wrote a review based on that stay, saying i thought the value vs. price was not worth it, that it was overpriced for the caliber of hotel it was purporting to be, but I TOTALLY retract my negative comments. i just stayed there again on my last visit to London and couldn't have stayed at a finer hotel. the price is very comparable to other luxury hotels in London and what you actually get in return is tremendous, beginning from the warm welcome by the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff, to the welcome glass of champagne and array of snacks, to the invitation to join them for canap茅s and drinks in the evening and the turndown service with candles, robes and slippers laid out. it's a true oasis from the rush of central London. you won't regret it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Above average, good value Spent 2 nights at the Eastgate Tower, in mid-town Manhattan. It is well located, close enough to Grand Central Station to catch the trains, a healthy but do-able walk to Broadway Theatres, and there's a decent bagel place (Daniel's) a couple of blocks away. The room (2 beds) was large, with a kitchenette, which is very convenient for storing and heating up food (there's an oven/range+ microwave, sink and fridge, with dishes and utensils provided). Maid service included dish-washing. TV was an older CRT model.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
Fantastic Our company used the Michelangelo Hotel for a business meeting with 16 participants. The hotel was fantastic, from the absolutely wonderful rooms to the service, and the great European feel. The staff was helpful, friendly and the meeting staff was available non-stop. They do not have a business office per se, however, they were willing to make copies for us in their offices, and Kinko's is a couple of blocks away. Definitely a great experience.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Fabulous hotel!! Service - view - location - pool! The Adlon is rated as one of the top 5 hotels in Europe, and with good reason!

Best hotel in Amsterdam This hotel is a personal favourite of mine. An Amsterdam townhouse on a quiet side canal, yet within walking distance of just about anything you want to see (and convenient for Anne Frank's house in particular). The rooms are HUGE, well appointed, with clean bathrooms, fridge, TV, buffet breakfast and friendly staff. It's the only place I would stay in Amsterdam.

Fairytale trip to the sky. What is not to like. We checked prices at several top rated hotels and this was the best deal for the money. The room was impecible, the service outstanding and the view was wonderful. The trip to the Top of the Mark was the topper with even greater views and a band you could actually dance too.

Great little hotel I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona and this hotel was great for my stay. The location is amazing, literally 2 minutes walk from La Rambla, a lot of people say this area is dodgy but as long as you don't walk around on your own it's fine and I never felt under threat going out for dinner at night, just try to stick to the busier roads rather than the small alleys. The hotel was extremely basic but clean which is the most important thing. We had a well equipped bathroom, a TV and a mini bar apart from tea making faciliites there was nothing more we needed. The staff are very helpful too. If you're looking for a budget hotel in Barcelona then this is a great option.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
>Caveat on 'Ocean View' Room We booked an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower. There was a nice view of the harbor, but the only way you could actually see the ocean from our room would be to step out onto the balcony and lean over to see a small sliver of Pacific. I complained that this did not constitute an ocean view in my mind, but the hotel staff told me that is how the room is classified, and refused to move us. Other then this disappointment, the hotel was great.####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Good, with a couple of minuses Many plus points distinguish this hotel - nice setting, friendly and cooperative staff, comfortable rooms.

Worst Hotel Stay... Ever!! We stayed here for the weekend to celebrate a bachelorette party. When we got to our room the door was wide open, our room key didn't work so we had to reactivate it every time we wanted to get back in, the floors were dirty, we didn't have enough beds to accodomate the girls, our window was broken with 90 degree hot air seeping in, no curtains to shade the room, and our bathroom light was broken! The hotel staff was rude and don't believe the pictures they show on their website, it looks nothing like that.

Nice little hotel in the middle of the big apple It a small hotel on the Manhattan side of the brooklyn bridge that is good for a business or pleasure traveler. Standard Hampton morning breakfast, helpful staff, but very small rooms, so if you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it might be cramped. Walking distance to most lower manhattan toruist sites, and the deli around the corner is very good.

lovely, just what you need if you are looking to stay somewhere pleasant but not too posh then this place is in a great location and not badly priced. we asked for a room with a view over the canal and it had great large windows for us to look out of.brekkie was nice and the bar at the front of the hotel was a nice atmosphere. For most people going to amsterdam, this place would be entirely suitable and in a great location.

We got it through priceline for $115 + tax.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral']]
value for money I stayed for 5 nights in the hotel , i must say it is value for money. it is very near to all amnesties, and city centre. the manger and his wife were very freindly. rooms anre clean and linen changed every day. i had superkiing size bed for single occupancy. overall impression is good apart from the neighbiurhood which is bit rough, but no troubl####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
super time, gorgeous place put simply, I loved this place. It was a nice little hideaway on a great shopping street. It was so pretty and quiet, the staff always smiling and happy to help. I must have called them for rides 10 times while I was there and it was never a problem. I also loved their pumpkin soup and lime juice. I hope to go back again, this time for my honeymoon.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Top Marks Top marks for this special boutique hotel, we loved it! The atmosphere is warm and really welcoming, all the staff very helpful. Comfortable room (fantastic marble bathroom) and superb view! Breakfast was excellent. Pity we weren't there in the warmer season when it's served in the courtyard (which looks delightful). We couldn't have wished for more and will certainly be back!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Great location! Great location base from which to explore Amsterdam. Basic amenities, but that was all we needed for a City break. Rooms were clean and serviced, breakfast was provided and there was plenty to fill up on. For the price we paid it was a great value for money and the reception staff were very helpful in answering questions, booking taxis etc. The only grumble was that there was a lot of noise in the night due to other guests coming back late!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
A fabulous jewel A fabulous boutique hotel in a neighborhood with spectacular views of the city.... we came for my 50th birthday and were upgraded to a city suite that was more memorable and charming than that of my honeymoon. We actually cancelled another reservation on our way back from Monterey Peninsula to stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Disappointing Given the reviews I read about the Oberoi and the reputation of the chain, I expected excellent and consistent service. We were surprised at the lack of consistency of the service and had a bad experience with the staff's confusion regarding whether breakfast was included in our rate. The management is clearly not doing its job in ensuring consistency and communication amongst the staff. The grounds, however, are beautiful and the location is lovely, however I think there are better value for money options in Bali.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Treat in Amsterdam I stayed at the Piet Hein with my boyfriend for 2 nights in March based on the user reviews posted on Trip Advisor and wasn't disappointed. This area of Amsterdam is great as it's out of the main hustle and bustle, near the museums and close enough to be able to hop on a tram and be in the heart of the action. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful and the place was clean as were the rooms - nice white linen and a bright, clean, modern bathroom. The hotel is also located right next to Vondel Park, great for strolling around and watching the locals run, jog and walk their dogs (sometimes at the same time!).I would definately go back here when next visiting Amsterdam.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Recommend this Hotel Have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and we would highly recommend it. The rooms are fine and spotless, the breakfast is great but what really makes the hotel is their fantastic staff who are friendly and willing to give good recommedations for restarants etc. The location is also good, very central and we had 3 rooms in different parts of the hotel and none of us suffered from any of the noise referred to in earlier reviews. - despite us being 40ish year old women.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Good Hotel My husband and I stayed at Plaza Lucchesi Hotel for 2 nights while in Florence. It was a good hotel but the location was a bit out of the way, it's not in the heart of the city and you either have to walk a bit or take a taxi to get anywhere. But its right on the river and restaurant is very good!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
Impossible to fault! This is just simply one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in - and there have been many! My husband and I plan to return to Amsterdam next year and I shall not even consider staying anywhere else. The hotel lives up to all the praise heaped on it by your other reviewers and is also exceptional value for money.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
better for pleasure than business As lovely as other kimptons in terms of quality of finish  amenities. Very servicable fitness area, in-room desks with wired net, cute nautical touches. Right smack in the heart of the tourist waterfront. I would come back with my spouse for vacation or if you're a business person dragging family then this would be a great fit. Some of the rooms are quite spacious and would be good for families. As a straight business traveler it was a distracting location, with a low noise level that I'd roll with if I were vacationing too but was hard to not feel curmudgeonly when I had 7:30 am meetings.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Quite happy Very near to the cable car stop, which was really handy, and a great touristy thing to do. The room itself was pretty average - a bit dated, but was adequate for our needs. Our room had a great view of the Golden Gate bridge which was good. Would probably go back.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Great Location Great location, would recommend this hotel for a city break! Just off the Placa Catalunya, but no problems with street noise, the room was fine.

Great value Hard to imagine better value for the money. The room was clean, the location great, the staff courteous (although sometimes a bit flustered). If you want great value, stay here. If you want a hotel where the staff grovel at your feet and lick your boots, then stay somewhere else and pay much more. A note for critics of the staff ...a few thoughtful words in French will pay substantial dividends in terms of service.####[['service general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Nice place for limited budget My experience with this place was very positive. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The location is excellent, close to several major tourist spots and close to public transportation (5-10 mins walk to underground stations and a bus stop (24) right in front of the hotel). For anyone who does not want to spend a fortune staying in London, I strongly recommend this place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Fabulous! We stayed here for 4 nights and loved every moment. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade so had the benefit of a high room with superb views. The location of the hotel was excellent and the staff very helpful. Would recommend this hotel to couples who like to be close to all the shops, bars and restaurants. Try out the revolving restaurant 'The View' in the Marriott Marquis, Times Square, fab views and the foods good too!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Helpful and friendly staff Comfortable well furnished rooms and one of the quietest hotel rooms I have stayed in. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as were the bar and restaurant staff. The two front door men were exceptional, always happy and helpful even in the dreadful weather Boston experienced during the whole 4 days. A well run hotel with pleasant helpful staff, a lot of whom have worked at the hotel for many years - always the sign of a good hotel. Boston is not one of my favourite city's but the Langham made it enjoyable.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Great stay at the Palomar Stayed here for five nights, excellent food and service. A meal in the resaurant is a must and the breakfasts are good, but expensive. Lovely quiet room at the back, no view to speak of but didn't need it as the hotels central location means that more time is spent outside the room than inside! Could not fault this hotel, a perfect place to start a holiday in California.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Decent, comfortable rooms Provides decent accomodation. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel with helpful staff, this most certainly is not the place. However, the rooms are clean and the parking is free. For a Boston hotel, the price is economical.

Good value hotel Very good value - we got a deal on Expedia and were pleasantly suprised by the hotel. It was very clean and comfortable and very centrally based in the main shopping district. The main tourist attractions are based in the Mitte; however these are easily reached by the U-Bahn or by the S Line from the nearby Zoo Bahnhoff. Good amenities and nightlife nearby and I would be happy to stay here again the next time I go to Berli####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

Recommended Hotel In Hong Kong Nice hotel on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong (I typically prefer Hong Kong Island side as its closer to my favorite shopping areas and cool neighborhoods like SoHo). I'm definitely a fan of the Shangri-La chain of hotels. The service is always fantastic and you get a feel for the Asian culture. The rooms are very nice, spacious, and well decorated. The lodging was very reasonable when I stayed there - around $200USD/night - more than worth it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Perfect for Hollywood Excellent location, just a couple of minutes walk from Hollywood Boulevard and within easy reach of other great attractions. Short Drive to Universal Studios.

A great hotel! This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service, and it is within walking distance of most attractions (we timed our selves strolling to the Duomo and it took about 6 minutes). I know that many times the star ratings on travel websites do not have any basis in realiity, however, this time I completely agree with the rating on Expedia.com that it is four star hotel. The rooms were great, the breakfasts were very nice, and I loved that the shower products are from the famed nuns at the Perfumia Santa Maria Novella. We stayed in Florence for a week and had a wonderful time.

Enjoyed our stay! We stayed here for a week while our daughter played soccer in the area and found this hotel modern, clean and the staff very helpful.

To Much Attitude and Bad Customer Service I stay at this hotel regularly for business. The attitude from the employees seems to get worse and worse each time.

Very good clean hotel Hi I stayed at this hotel because of its central position, I found the hotel to be ideal for me. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the maid service is excellent.

Great hotel Just got back from a 4 night stay at this hotel, which I thoroughly recommend. The room was lovely, really big and with added extras such as free aveda toiletries, a well-stocked mini bar and a pillow menu, so you can choose the pillow that suits you and your needs best! And the club room on the 2nd floor is well worth taking advantage of, with big comfy leather sofas, a huge TV and free tea, coffee and water at all times and best of all - free wine and cheese Monday-Thursday between 6pm and 7pm! The staff were also great, really friendly and helpful. The location is good, between third and Lex with a subway station within a block and Grand Central a short walk away, and it is within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants all down second and third avenues. I would stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Over rated We just came back from a 3 night stay at this hotel. The room ( # 6 ) is very small and obviously the web site photos are very unrealistic. Furthermore facing the street and canal you are assured of sleepless nights from all the party goers at nearby Rembrandtplein.

Loved everything about this hotel We were looking for a property near LAX, only 7 minutes away and compared to the LAX airport high rises this was a steal. From the welcoming reception, cookies and apples in the lobby, upscale furniture and the cutest open courtyard with bistro sets this hotel does it right.

Gem in a Non-Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed. I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don't know about this place. We got great service, a great view, a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels (e.g., the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical/health activities). I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them. I can see why -- nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes (mostly) of tourists. I want to stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Pleasant Surprise This hotel was definitely a pleasant surprise. White the room was a bit small/tight, it was very well redone, with an absolutely awesome view of the beach. While it is a block from the beach, there's not much in between to kill the view. The lobby is OK - a bight tight, and the Mezz floor is low celienged (very 1970's!), but the rest of the place is very nice, and well priced. Would definitely recommend it over most others in Waikiki - unless you really want to stay right on the beach and pay a lot more.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'neutral'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Nice hotel in the heart of Amsterdam This hotel is certainly an institution in Amsterdam. It is very nice inside, but the staff is sometimes a little rude and posh and rooms look pretty old.

Great Hotel ,perfect location I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni and really if you want an excellent hotel in a great location this has to be your choice. The rooms are of a good size with large bathrooms and a walk in shower, i had a premier room which was an upgrade from a deluxe room which i paid for ,to recieve this uprade sign up to Omni Hotels signature program and you will recieve this for free as well as other benefits such as late check out. As all the other reviews state the staff are excellent, i travelled with my 2 year old daughter and all the staff made a fuss of her. As far as location goes to me this is in the best location in the city union square shopping is 10 mins walk in one direction and fishermans walf 20 mins in the other and north beach and chinatown on your doorstep, although there are plenty of buses ,cable cars and taxis if you want to take it easy. I booked with hotel connect a uk website which were 拢400 cheaper on my booking than any other website.

Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris, I was concerned to choose well. After reading several reviews on the internet, I selected the Hotel D'Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice. The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was 'at the heart' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme, Louvre, Pompidou Centre, Pantheon etc. The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright, clean, and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate. All in all, the Hotel D'Albe surpassed all our expectations, and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit.

Not bad Hotel was about 20-25 minute walk to the centre of Florence. The room was clean, with a good shower and the staff were friendly. The only downside were the banging of doors late at night and in the early hours from other guests 'coming and going'. It did get on your nerves after a while and stopped a good nights sleep.

Very nice Not a lot to complain about really - inexpensive, superb location very close to station, air-conditioned rooms, lovely building and al fresco breakfast included in price! Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax, a 10% tax that everyone has to pay. Although it's possible for non-Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $300, that doesn't apply to services. You've got a great hotel guys, worth $165 per night of anyone's money, so why not be honest about your prices?####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Really fantastic This hotel is in an excellent location for visiting London and the tube is just a short walk away on the same street. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very new and modern - it has a boutique feel to it. There is plenty of choice for breakfast, although it does cost 拢21 if it's not included in your price, which is a bit steep. There are 3 or 4 cafes, aswell as an MS food shop, across from the hotel that you could eat breakfast in. Would recommend this hotel without a doubt.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Recommended, but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online. I'm sure this hotel is fine for vacationers: the rooms are ok (especially the kitchenettes), the location is pretty good, and the staff are helpful. However, I don't recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer. The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm, and the wireless internet mostly non-existent (at least while I was staying). It just isn't worth it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative']]
Spacious room A nice, clean hotel located in the downtown area. My room was very spacious with a fridge and microwave. Rate was much lower than other downtown hotels plus the parking is free. A bit of a walk to some of the tourist areas but nothing is too far away. The free cookies at night are yummy!####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
very chic but lacks hotel services Very nice hotel - clean, just refurbished, - it is my own fault but I had assumed that there would be some sort of room service or some facitilites to make tea/coffee in your room there are not - the only food served is breakfast which you have to go downstairs to eat and there is only a minibar with some water etc in your room - if you want anything hot you have to go out and get it.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]
Good Location, pleasant manager We just spent 2 nights at the Relais Bosquet and it was very enjoyable. The location is very close to the Eiffel Tower as well as many museums, etc. We had a 5th floor room with a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. There is complimentary coffee/tea in the room, and there are washcloths. While the room wasn't large and needs updating, it was more than adequate for us.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews, we were a bit weary about this hotel. It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop. What valuables we did have (passports, cash etc) was stored in the reception safe and always available. Staff were friendly enough, but the main attraction is this hotel's location right on the bustling las ramblas. If it's a quiet place you're after don't book here, but if it's a clean budget hotel right in the heart of things, we would absolutely recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
New Hotel with nice accomodations I've just stayerd at The Westin hotel in San Francisco wich has a terrible name since it's called Market street and it's located at Third street, but on the other hand it has an excellent location, just 1 block away from all main business and commercial area at downtown SF and at the corner with Four Seasons hotel... Nice experience, nice price and excellent accomodations, although the lounge service was awful...####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Fastastic Value and convenient to airport. This reasonably priced hotel was the surprize of our trip. The hotel is located less than a block from SEA-TAC an has 24 hour shuttle. Coast appears to have undergone a recent remodel, and the did an excellent job. Located on International Blvd and next to the airport I was surprized to find that neither the street noise nor air-traffic were loud. Several nearby restuarants, and the hotel had a very good free breakfast.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Il Bargellino rocks! I loved everything about Il Bargellino. The location, the rooms, the outdoor rooftop living area were all perfect for a relaxing and memorable stay in Florence. Carmel and Pino are wonderful hosts and were so helpful in providing us insight on the best places to eat, shop, sightsee and thoroughly enjoy our stay. I'd recommend Il Bargellino to anyone visiting Florence for a day, a week, or a month!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Fantastic meals and very nice spa The meals are fantastic, especially the buffet breakfasts. The Sunday brunch is unbelievably decadent and a great value despite the high price. The spa is very nice; I had a great pedicure and haircut. The rooms are on the small size, but they are extremely well designed, especiallt he bathroom. Our original room was overlooking a parking lot, but after we asked to be switched we were given a beautiful room with an ocean view.####[['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

So comfortable! 15th July, 2006This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
WE LOVED IT. Berlin was the start of our Europe trip and the Westin was a great start to our holiday. Without doubt when in Berlin we will try to stay here again. The location is perfect (a few minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag),the heavenly beds are heavenly, the buffet breakfast is superb and the quality of the hotel far exceeded our expectations. We were there for 3 nights in February and with limited time location is so important - and this hotel was the perfect choice.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam, but it wasn't too far from it. It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night. It was clean and comfortable, but nothing spectacular. There were a few burn marks, probably from smokers, but I guess that's to be expected in Amsterdam. The free breakfast was decent, and at least it was free, a rarity in Europe.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
The Best We normally stay at 5 star hotels and this is a 4 star. We were also a bit sceptical when we saw the pictures of the bright rooms on the web but this was the best hotel.

The views are just to die for!!! Stayed here for a long week-end, November 4th - 8th, in Room 308 and the views from that room were marvellous, the Louvre, the Musee D'Orsay and the Eiffel Tower and we overlooked the Tuilleries, these views were even better at night when Paris was lit-up!!! The room was comfortable, fantastic bathroom - huge and the bed was one of the most comfy that I have slept in anywhere in the world and the hotel is in a wonderful location. Breakfast is a bit disappointing, the pain au chocolat at the Musee D'Orsay are superb!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]
Nice location on clarke quay Hotel rooms were clean. Was given a room that could accommodate 2 adults and 3 children which was 2 double beds and a rollaway which was great. The children enjoyed the pool area which was well maintained. The location is great as the MRT is close and lots of restaurants. Restaurants at the hotel are a little pricey but that is normal for Singapore. Stayed 3 nights and had no problems.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5, 2005. It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10:20 p.m. on the night of Saturday 2nd. It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night. I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me. I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night. Luckily the security latch was on the door and the intruder could not enter.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great Location My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our way back to the UK. Plus points - The hotel is in a great location on Union Square and the inside of the hotel looked very nice.

Be very aware of the location This is a lovely restored hotel on Market Street in San Fancisco. The problem is that it's the wrong end of Market Street.

very nice airport hotel Was very pleased with this hotel. Rooms are very large, well appoingted but with plenty of space for luggage etc. Breakfast was more than adequate, with made-to-order omelets, and the whole facility was immaculate and actually worked! Only negatives we noted were shuttle service from LAX is on request which we didn't know and lost some time waiting curbside before calling, and if you rent a car or drive, note that hotel parking is $15.00 per nite. Since it is very close to the airport the aircraft noise might bother light sleepers/children.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

It was better than we expected for the money; nice, big room, tiles and heat lamp in the bathroom, great location, very clean, and the helpful man at the front desk told us where to go and where not to go.

mfortable and well equipped Great location for exploring the latin quarter and St Germain, but still an easy walk into the centre of Paris. We just used it as a crash pad, so were barely here.

Good restaurant In total I was there several weeks. The people from the restaurant did much more than their best, good food. Overall service was OK, although there was a hick-up, but the people from the restaurant restored that. Very negative: the beds: too soft!!!

Be Warned: Polyester Sheets First of all, this place is really really cheap, so I feel a little bad complaining, also the staff were genuinely concerned when i brought this matter to their attention,however, the sheets here are some kind of polyester blend, so even though it may be freezing cold outside, you will not need to turn on the heat, you will sweat up a storm and wake up wet. I didn't sleep too well once i realized i was sleeping on a mattress that must be drenched with the sweat of a thousand previous guests.i would not stay here again, even with it being cheap.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
Very good I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews on here - unless parts of the hotel are still being renovated. I stayed in the tower part which was very good - air conditioning was excellent which in Singapore is a must. The rooms are quite small (the bathroom especially), but otherwise a decent place to stay for a few days. There was a regular free bus into town, and it's only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay (about 30 mins to Orchard Road).Happily stay again, although as ever I do resent having to pay extra for the internet when you pay a fair whack for the room in the first place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Very average indeed The room was large and comfortable, but I was not otherwise terribly impressed with this place.

Very central to Union Square and transport links, I was very pleased with my find as we were so central!Good bed in average sized room, very large bathroom, breakfast supplied in lobby in the morning is the average American continental danish and coffee.

Great value for money I stayed here 2 years ago and whilst I knew that the rooms can be shabby, due to the location and an excellent deal at $70 per night (inl breakfast) I thought it was worth the money. We seem to have lucked out though and got a far superior room to the one we had before (or they've just decorated!)and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. If you want an average 3* which is definitely a hotel and not a hostel, I would recommend and stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Wonderful Experience - Excellent Customer Service Stayed for one night this past weekend and got a terrific rate through an online newsletter. In spite of the rate, we were treated like honored guests and upgraded to an incredibly large room since the check-in folks noted that we were travelling with two kids. Requests for foam pillows and a rolloway were answered promptly and my children loved the kids welcome pack at check-in. Truly superior service all around from valet parking to baggage check to front desk. Loved the hotel and location and will definitely stay again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great hotel, great service, great location! My family of four, including two teenage boys stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is excellent, the rooms, although fairly small, were certainly big enough for the four of us and were well maintained and very nicely decorated. We received very good service and would definitely stay there again if we return to Boston.

Great Hotel, no Monkey Bar This is a wonderful hotel that is similar to many classy European hotels. The room (76) was elegant and clean, and the location was perfect.

Not at all what is used to be This once was a nice hotel which has gone for the cheapercrowd, tatoo people, Mom Dad 3 kids in a room type deal + events. Way too small to handle both conferences and wedding events on the same day along with family outings. This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences, cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd, and weddings anyday of the week which means: bottom line the facilities are not available 24/7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard. What was once a $400 night hotel for the business, elite traveler is now a $49-79night cheap 4 star; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline, this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed.

Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you'd go to if you want a really upscale, romantic place to stay. BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam. It's a two minute walk to the Dam Square, 10 minute walk to the Central Station and within easy walking distance of everything in central Amsterdam. The hotel is clean and quiet an comfortable, but I would say the key selling point is the fact that it is so well located.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

Just the job Nice little hotel this, right on top of shopping, the Ramblas and a bit of nightlife to boot. Rooftop swimming pool big enough for a cooling dip if you are there when it is warm enough and felt a bit like a scene from a spanish mary poppins looking out over the rooftops from the pool terrace. Rooms well appointed and breakfast adequate. Trying to get a drink from the hotel bar was a challenge but if you are not in a hurry you will get one.

The service is really bad and not to mention things disappear from your room and their respond is we are investigating it, they charge you for compelementry coffee, and it takes them five hours to get you a taxi to the air port.

Good location but now looking dated Stayed at the Blacket for 7 nights from the 28.12.06, we were charged a huge supplement for New Year and were annoyed to find the hotel restaurant was closed, the only choice for breakfast was an over priced continental breakfastLeaking ceiling took 4 days to fixLocation is great, room was large but very drab. The hotel was probally cool a few years ago but is now looking old and tired. Staff are helpful but no room service or help with your bags. Overall Ok but if you are loooking for a spacious room in a central location.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
I would go again We went to Barcelona for a shopping trip and we booked Hotel Marina over the internet and said we would spend one night but end up staying three nights there. The staff were very firendly and best of all the spoke english which is alot of help, the room was very clean and the location was perfect 8 min walk to the beech and two stops away by metro into the city centre.the only problem was the taxi's at night from the hotel into the town centre they charged what they like but the hotel was great i would stay there agai####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

clean and family friendly We enjoyed our clean room and the wonderful service. We ordered room service and my two young children (4 and 6) had plenty of delicious options on the kid's menu.

Nice family run place Nice family run place about a 10 minute walk from the train station. Decent accomodation.

Stylish and Sophisticated Soho Hotel was very modern and stylish. The hotel was clean and maintained to a very high standard. Soho hotel is located close to Las Ramblas and all the main attractions but was in an area that was not noisy during the night. The staff were friendly and helpful and spoke good English.

vercharged at check out! The hotel room was fine, rather small but ok. What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate. Of course at check out, they upped my rate even after I reminded them and they assured that I was getting the the lower rate but charged my credit card more. I traveled throughout Europe and this was the only hotel that charged me a higher rate. I would probably not return.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Good location,Quite, Clean, and Great price We spent 4 night at Grant hotel, a very good choice for us for the first time visit San Francisco.

A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol. True--but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels' and it's a 20 euro cab ride. My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties--a reservation canceled without notice, a free wifi system that was down (a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords), a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks. This hotel is in a suburban business district--it may be very convenient and useful on workdays; my very short stay there, on a Saturday, after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip, was nothing but a series of frustrations.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative']]
Great Petit Hotel, Superb location! Very nice hotel, in the very center of florence, the street on which it resides is the street that goes from the duomo to the ponte vecchio, right in the middle of those 2 attractions and just 1 block away form the piazza de la republicca. Great fares! Service is very nice, views are amazing. The only thing I would improve is room size though...

Fantastic hotel in NO This hotel was a pleasant surprise in New Orleans. I'd never stayed in a Drury hotel, and now I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. The lobby was lovely, there was a full hot breakfast, sodas available during the day, staff was friendly, beds were comfortable and room was clean with marble tiles in entrance and bathroom. Most importantly, all Drury hotels are pet friendly, and my dog had a great time looking out our 8th floor window at the streets of New Orleans. It was a short walk to the french quarter, and the streetcar lines are right outside the door.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Large quiet rooms with great service! I stayed for 3 days and was amazed at the size of the room. Having stayed in other NYC hotels, this is by far one of the best for the price. The kitchen was a big money saver and the staff was friendly, knowledgable and helpul. I had to day-sleep needed to change rooms due to construction - they were most gracious.

Restaurant Recs The Ritz is a terrific hotel but their restaurant recommendations need updating.

Great location, excellent value We stayed 3 nights in the Royal Magda for during half term and booked a double and a large double with sofa bed for our 3 children (415 and 416). Our stay was excellent value for a mid-priced three star hotel. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the location was very convenient. The rooms were small but adequate and the breakfast room was a bit of a squash but otherwise no complaints.

Good location - dirty bathroom Supposed to be a five star hotel, however this was not exactly what I would call 5 stars. Pros:-great location - convenient for walking places - tianamen, restaurants etc-safe-internet-nice building interiors, food, spa-courteous staff-decent priceCons:-dirty bathroom - moldy, water didn't drain in shower-smelly hallways - my entire hallway smelled of mold and cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a smoke free hallOverall: I'd stay here since this seemed to be a common theme for higher end hotels in China. I'd look for newer hotels first, but could stay here again based on price.

we like the St Francis This is a lovely hotel with a sense ot charm and history. However it is a bit dated in places, (corridors and rooms), however it is really in a great location, right overlooking Union Square, right in the midst of it all, and close to shops, restaurants etc. we were on our honey moon so they gave us a special room which was really quite big and nicely furnished. the champagne mojitos in the bar were pretty excellent too.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Nikko - Clean and convenient. I stayed at the Nikko for 2 days prior to a cruise from San Francisco to Alaska. When I had to change dates at the last minute due to plane problems, the hotel was extremely accommodating. The staff was very helpful and always cheerful during my stay. The hotel is only a block from several great restaurants and a three block walk from Union Square and all the shopping you could want. The price is a bit steep, but the clean and comfortable room with a 42 HDTV made up for it.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24/7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino, but the rooms themselves are a little tired. That said, they're still well equipped - the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in had everything we needed, except for the absolute lack of patio furniture. Beds were clean and comfy, and the lounge room was roomy. The hotel is starting to show its age though, and the standard prices are several times what they should be. If you want to stay somewhere nice and central (and open around the clock), check out local hotel websites in advance and you should be able to score a room here at half the price or less.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

Just perfect We stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in January, 2006. We arrived a full 39 hours late, due to snow in Tokyo, but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren't there. They even let us stay for an extra night, at the same very low rate. The hotel was great; lots of space, clean, very central to everything in Waikiki, but very quiet too.

Great Customer Service... Stayed for two nights and was placed into the wrong room type on the first night due to 'overbooking'. This was not a bother as I was by myself for the first night.

Tiny room with many ants The room wasn't available to check-in until late afternoon. Once in the tiny room we discovered it was full of ants. I would estimate there were over 20 to 30 ants on the floor at one time. Telling the front desk attendant about the ants, she seem unconcerned and was suprised this was an issue. Having no other rooms we checked-out and were not charged.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Excellent accomodations. Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace. It is a lovely hotel deserving of it's 5 star rating. The employees were very helpful, very accomodating. Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money, asking about areas we wanted to visit, ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants, even getting a massage. This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]

Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september. Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF, we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel.

Good hotel - but watch your wallet This hotel has character and is in an excellent location. The restaurant is very good - reasonable prices, huge menu, very popular. Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned. Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street. Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room. The hotel (and cleaner) were no doubt banking (correctly) that we wouldn't bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Not more than ok Spent 3 nights at this motel early July. Rooms ok, clean but rather small and without a wardrobe to hang clothes. We were travelling for a month and had 3 suitcases for which we hardly found space in the room. Fridge and micro stuffed into the room, no place to eat except in bed. Similar to another review, we also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude from the owners, demanding our credit card for security even if the stay was prepaid through Expedia, and it was also not the place for asking questions. Location ok, a bit far down on Lombard Street but as Norwegians we're used to walking.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Affordable but dumpy I'm kind of shocked to read all the great reviews of this hotel. It was an inexpensive hotel for the area yes, but grungy and worn. The bed was very uncomfortable.

With many Boston hotels averaging $250 per night, we had a perfectly acceptable king-size room for just under $100 including parking.

Decent deal, decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean, has a modern Asian feel in the decour, and a decent breakfast to start you on your way. The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge. Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring. This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn't seem to know where it was. The surrounding neighbourhood seems a little run-down but perhaps this is just the old feel of the place.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

bad first impression The Operator who picks up the phone at the general number gave me the wrong fax number. Then when I called back to inquire, the second person was very curt in correcting me, not only was there no apology, she hung up on me as I was still talking without even a 'good bye'. This kind of service attitude is simply not acceptable anywhere, let alone a hotel of this level.

Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed!!We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great. For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast, be early it gets very busy. The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk.

Good Budget Hotel... Key Word = Budget Monte Carlo is clean, fairly comfortable (very firm beds) and best of all, well located.

We ended up staying 2 nights from our room overlooking the Golden Gate.. I would Highly recommend this Hotel to anyone planning a trip to the S.F. area - my only complaint was the $32.00 a night Valet parking fee (Optional)..####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Never again On arrival, front desk informed us that we had cancelled our 7-night reservation earlier that day. After much discussion, they found us a room, facing a brick wall, and never offered to move us. Most unfriendly staff, but clean room. We use Holiday Inns all the time, but this was one of the worst.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
Great Hotel Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of August and I have to say it was fab. From the moment we arrived every member of staff we came into contact with was friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. The room was lovely, nice decor and extremely clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit San Francisco.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Wonderful hotel with easy access to City Wonderful, clean and comfortable rooms. The beds are super comfy. The shower was incredible...wanted to take it home! Location to the DART is great.

Band kids were not well controlled, resturant service bad Husband, dtr, and I stayed here in order to get flight out next morning. Hotel room as expected for Embassy Suites, Noise level on bedroom side from road very loud and disturbing. H.S. band in hotel for Fiesta Bowl were still running wild at 11pm. Service at resturant was terrible, food mediocre. Would not eat there again, would not stay here again.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Good location, needs renovated The website inaccurately reported the hotel had been renovated. Carpets were worn, common areas not clean and the furnishings dated. Staff was friendly and the location is convenient to shopping and restaurants. Exterior of building looks shabby and spalling is evident. The hotel is not being maintained.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location, that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar, and the rudness of the people at the front desk. Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise, and when you only need five minutes to get to any place, you forget the rudness of the front desk staff. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was ok, and remember this, if is clean and has a great location, the restis not important. Will definitely come back here. They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm, with very good food.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
loved this hotel loved this classy hotel. lovely lobby, beautiful rooms, pleasant staff. Didn't eat here but located short stroll from upmarket outdoor mall with nice restaurants/cafe. Valet parking good service but pricey. When returned to UK appeared to have been charged the wrong amount to our credit card - tried to sort out by email but are insisting we write to them if we want a copy of our account -not hugely convenient when you live on the other side of the world. hope to get this sorted out as appear to have been significantly overcharged and if we can't sort it would not stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Great hotel in Barcelona Super nice and very luxurious hotel in a good location - nice neighborhood within easy walking distance of everything. Underground train stations also nearby.

Top location! Before booking a hotel, I always look at this site for guidance! I was a little worried by the some of the reviews for the hotel Lloret posted here, but given the hotel's location I went ahead and booked.... I'm so glad I did, the location is fantastic! If you are looking for a clean, safe hotel with a prime location and super friendly/helpful staff, then this is the place for you.

great everything Booked this hotel through Last Minute.com when my other hotel booking was in euros and needed a better deal. This hotel was first class, on arrival at reception got served immediately given all the info I needed with maps and details of trips and buses. room was very clean, the bed was huge, the buffet breakfast was brilliant and catered for every taste. The hotel was a 5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port, with regular buses and a metro stop outside. Ended up walking everywhere as the sights are not far apart, a brilliant weekend,thanks####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Misrepresentation We booked three hotel rooms, w/two double beds. We made our reservations six weeks in advance. When we checked in, we were informed that we would not receive what we reserved, because we did not call to confirm. We had the confirmation page that was sent to us. They gave us cots, instead. Blatant misrepresentation!####[['service general', 'negative']]
HARMING This hotel scored excellent in every regard... The staff, especially Rory at the front desk and OJ were great!!! Valet parking made it especially easy to check in and out... Great food in the hotel too!!I'll stay there again and again and have already referred some SF regulars from my home town, Monterey. Good value!! ! A.

uld be better Just got back from a week in Seattle and loved almost every minute of it. The Pacific Plaza, while a good buy, could use some improvement. We were on the top (8th floor) and all the heat in the builidng seemed to rise into our room. Also, while the room was non-smoking, the internal ventilation system seemed to draw in smoke from other rooms. The staff was very courteous and helpful, and the location is very good.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

in the center of it all... The main attraction to this hotel is location/ price... you are next to three of the main subway lines in Tokyo and can walk to many great restaurants and attractions. The hotel room was good for the location and filled with gadgets- such as the operable shade opening device- no need to get out of bed in the morning!The staff was friendly, it would be great if they learned a little more english though...####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great place to stay We stayed for 7 nights in a Junior suite. Only has positive things to say about the Affinia Dumont -staff were excellent, professional and friendly the room was spotless and large, bathroom  kitchen were fine for our needs and the king size bed was great. The location on 34th betw.

Absolute Magic This hotel is a real dream. The building and everything in it is gorgeous, and the staff are absolutely first class.

Best location and very nice rooms The Herbert Hotel is located close to the Union Square, the very center of SF, and on Powell Street. The hotel is new-decorated from top-to-tow and has a 4-stars-hotel room standard. You have everything just around the corner and a very good location for all attractions in the city, including BART, bus and cable car.

Excellent room and service The room was excellent, and the staff very friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. They also arranged a doctor to visit the hotel to see our young daugther, and then also interpreted. My only observation is that you probably don't need to book a canal room as there's not a huge amount to see out of the windows. You'll enjoy the stay####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Awful hotel I spent one night only, fortunately, in this hotel. Upon arrival we had to pay cash before entering the room, theN we found on one bed , dirty linen that had to be changed. The room lacked maintenance on the furniture and in the bathrrom nothing was repared. In the morning breakfast was very poor and when i asked forchocolate for my child they did not have any. And to finish we asked to leave the luggage for the day and it was kept outside in a courtyard getting wet because of the rain. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great Base for City Visit Stayed at The Prescott for two nights. The location near Union Square is extremely convenient for shopping around the Square and in the excellent Westfield Centre, the cable cars along Powell towards Fisherman's Wharf and Muni along Market towards Embarcadero. The staff were friendly and efficient providing information, printing out boarding passes, storing luggage and providing a town car to the airport. The room was not large but the furnishings, bedding and bathroom were all of a high standard. We would readily stay at The Prescott agai####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
In the middle of the City Very pleasant hotel in the City, only at one minute by feet from the Ramblas.

unbelievably unhelpgul!! I am staying at Spaulding at the moment. We only have a few days so we wanted to quickly arrange some trips - but the extremely unfriendly receptionist has flatly refused to help us, or even let us use the phone to call the tour companies. We have no phone, the internet is too slow, so we're now setting off to macy's third floor to find a payphone. I am speechless!!####[['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Loved The Mansion on Turtle Creek My husband and I stayed at the Mansion on Turtle Creek following our wedding.

pretty standard, good location Me and my wife stayed at Coral Princess Inn on November 2005. The hotel has a very good location and the area is quiet and decent. We are not the type of people to whine about the change of sheets and spots on the walls, but there seemed to be a major problem with their air conditioning at the room we were staying in. We got that little room no 12 for 99 USD per night on the second floor. The temperature in the room was never under 32 degrees celcius and we found it hard to sleep sometimes.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Big rooms, near the night-life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise. Very well-located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well-decorated. Service is good-enough and the stairs (there's no elevator) can be scary if you have big suitcases. Very good deal, specially for young couples. It can be a little noisy at night due the bars around, but nothing that bothers too much.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

couldn't wait to leave this hotel although the views from our room were drop dead gorgeous we were completely bored at the Mandarin Oriental and felt isolated in a sterile cube. the room furnishings lacked the austere beauty I'd been hoping for - the room's furnishings were quite plain and unremarkable. we were in a bridge to bridge view room - expensive - but we didn't feel pampered or special while staying at the hotel in any way. room service food was quite plain; good quality ingredients but not particularly delicious or gourmet. we actually felt a bit depressed in this hotel, we couldn't wait to leave - so we checked out a day early.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]
Not what we expected We were to stay at the Riu Palace Macao for five nights, we stayed one. The facilities were old and mold was a definite problem for us. The room was outdated and not up to the four star rating as given on the internet website. The food and service were way below average. The drive to the resort was down right frightening.####[['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]
Great Stay Wondeful hotel in Florence! A little out of the way (but still can walk to everything in 10 minutes or less). Front desk was great - had to check out very early so when I called for a wake-up call, the operate ordered a cab for me to arrive at a certain time and they packed a breakfast for me (because I'd miss the free breakfast). Room was very comfortable and a good size.

Not so bad... I went with the expectations of a horrible experience because of the reviews, but it wasn't so bad... The facilities were nice but the areas of concern are the lighting in the rooms and restaurants...too dark, the service at the hotel was put off-ish, passing the buck. For a better time, take stomach medicine and your own towels.

One of the best Hilton Hotels This is really one of the best Hilton Hotels we have ever stayed at.

They won us over We weren't sure about this hotel at first - it needs a bit of TLC and a lick of paint in some areas, but the staff made it for us. We didn't see one rude member of staff - all were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is extremely well located and being on the fourth floor we didn't hear any noise at all - even though Barcelona had just won the league and the streets were alive with cheering mobs of football fans when we arrived! I would definately stay here again.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
lean and good location but aimed at gay community. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but small. We believe they cater for a gay market, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont. We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite, we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money, the rooms are huge. We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river. I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had, however, on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill. A lovely hotel in a great location and if we visit New York again we would not hesitate to stay here.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Never stay here! Whew, this place was bad. The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn't let my kids in it, the whole place smelled, and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments. I was literally scared of this place, and when I reported it to the desk, they just said they couldn't stop the calls because they were coming from within the building.

I bit expensive but worth it The hotel is located right in the Ostbahnhof so very good location for getting around the city and out of the city. It is a bit expensive but if you take into consideration that you get a good breakfast included, and free transportation on all the S bahns, U bahns and busses, it is worth it. You just go downstairs and the train station and the S Bahn is just down there. Also a mall with all kinds of restaurants and shops.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
uld not have been more pleased.... After relying on Trip Advisor (once again) we booked a 4-day stay at Iberville Suites and could not have been more pleased, The location is perfect - 1 block from Bourbon Street and all the action - but the QUIETEST hotel we have ever stayed in! All of the employees we came in contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fine - but of course one day you'll want to go to Cafe Dumond for those amazing beignets. The rooms are very, very clean and it truly is a suite - separate sitting area, 2 TVs, etc. We would most definitely return.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]

Lovely hotel I wanted a great hotel in Amsterdam with a pool for a leisure stay. The Amstel was the most fantastic place to stay; cost an arm and a leg but worth it if you can afford it. Great room, food, service, nothing at all to complain about.

Still my favourite - but... This is definately my favourite hotel in Paris (considering my budget).Great location, friendly staff, surprising design features, nice rooms, clever lay out, but... we were lucky. Friends travelling with us stayed in the same hotel, at the same rate but didn't really get what we got. They walked into a really tiny and a little run down room, and the bathroom was very tiny and didn't 'feel' clean. So picking this hotel is like playing the lottery. You can get lucky - like we did, or you can be less lucky like our friends.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Lived up to Expectations There is no point repeating the comments on other reviews. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff are excellent. Ask for a room away from the front of the hotel as the street is noisy early in the morning. It seems local properties receive deliveries from approxiamately 5.00am. The outside bar courtyard area and additional garden at the back of the hotel are very quiet and relaxing####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict']]
Would Stay There Again and Again I have been to Amsterdam a half-dozen times in the last few years, and Seven Bridges is where I will stay the next time and the time after that. The location is nearly unbeatable. The view from canal-side rooms is unbeatable. The rooms are charming, spotless and spacious. The price was right. I have paid a lot more for standard Amsterdam charmless fare, but I won't again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Lovely place to stay Lovely place to stay. After reading the reviews on tripadvisor, my girl-friend and I decided to go for this hotel. The staff were very helpful with everything our hearts desired (calling a cab, giving us directions, carrying our bags up to the room and down again when we left), the breakfast was a treat , the rooms were very romantic and clean and the location was superb.

A Very Special Place I had done a lot of research into hotels in Venice and with the help of the reviews on tripadvisor I booked my girlfriend and I into the Hotel Al Ponte. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and can honestly say that it was one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The rooms were extremely clean and very comfortable. The hosts we helpful and attentive at all times without being pushy!!!The location of this hotel is brilliant, close to everything yet far enough away to enjoy a walk through the streets of Venice to the main sights.

Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia. The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted, but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations. Not the best news for our daughters, who were eager to swim after the flight! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door, but whilst better than nothing, this was not terribly convenient. The hotel offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd, but is showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc. However, I found there was some rather foul stains (females staying along do not make marks like that) on the duvet cover, which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc. Really not acceptable in a hotel aiming to be top tier and fairly disgusting. So check your bedsheets before climbing into bed there.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative']]
An enjoyable hotel I stayed here recently while attending activites at UCLA. The hotel was well-managed and charming with a clean, soft-modern feel. Regarding location: it would be difficult to do much better as everything is quite close (including the Getty). This hotel, of course, would not be a good pick for someone seeking a high-energy or party atmosphere. It was a relaxing and enjoyable place to spend time in Los Angeles.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
an't wait until we can afford to visit again. We stayed in the King bed, with Jacuzzi suite. A wonderful room! The Jacuzzi is 5.5' x 3' - huge! Just remember to bring your bubble bath mixture with you. The service was excellent, and we were made to feel very welcome.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Clean Room / Great Location / Excellent Price I was entirely satisfied with my stay at the Prince Conti. I was shocked to find a safe and clean room at a price as low as the Prince Conti's midweek rates. While the hotel may lack some of the amenities of the 5-star New Orleans hotels, it is still an ideal place to catch your breath before heading back out to the Quarter or the Faubourg Marigny. It is clean, comfortable, and affordable.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Great experience! We stayed at this hotel for three nights in total. The first on our arrival in Phoenix prior to our driving tour round and were so impressed we reserved a room for the nights prior to flying back out of Phoenix to Holland. Everything was clean, the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful - from giving us milk at 2am to help us sleep as we were jet lagged to arranging the shuttle bus to take us to Mills avenue so we could go for a night on the town!!Having toured round for two weeks the amenities and service here were not beaten along our travels - high speed internet, breakfast, pool, spa, vending machines, fridge, microwave. Would definitely recommend!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Great location and friendly hotel I chose this hotel mainly due to location as I was taking my Mum who can't walk so far - but it was a great choice alround. We were upgraded to one of the new apartments which was great and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is very good and the light snacks in the roof bar are excellent - plus the open terrace is a great location to sit and have a glass of wine and admire the view. Very good location and close to some very good restaurants. Would recommend if you want to be in the heart of the City.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Vacationing at the Melia? Think again! The Melia Caribe, being a 5-star hotel, has very poor service and over-rated food. There's not much to do during the day and no night entertainment that is worth watching. Clubs are practically dead and the resort is extremely large which makes it a bit inconvenient.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative']]
There are better places in NOLA Good conference rooms for large group. But the hotel can not handle it when it comes to house keeping. The bar was really bad. We had to find some place else to go because the service was so poor. When to comes to NOLA service, this place was not what you would expect.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'conflict']]

Fantastic hotel, fantastic city Planned a four week vacation to Australia and found trip advisor to be totally helpful to me, felt like I should share my experience.

Lovely hotel in convenient location This hotel is conveniently located to the train station and all the key sites. We walked every where. The hotel and breakfast room were lovely.

Great value The rooms are pretty old, but clean. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from union square and market street.

great location This is a very clean and comfortable hotel right in the center of Madrid. The bathroom was very nice for European standards.

Stay here! This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms (we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious). Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly. I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars. I would have rated it higher and I'm very picky about hotel accomodations. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
Great Location Have now stayed here twice. The hotel represents good value for NYC and has an excellent health centre and pool. Other public areas are also impressive.

We had our things STOLEN in our room The hotel was aweful, the room door a joke. We had merely arrived and left the hotel room for only one hour to have diner. When we got back, somebody had broken into our room (307) and had stolen our camera, phone, mp3 player, among other things. AVOID THIS HOTEL, even if it is the last available room in the whole of Barcelona.####[['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Loved the location Just came back from spending New Years in NYC. The Marquis was the BEST hotel to be at for New Year's Eve.

We couldn't cross Broadway without it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Loved the Marriott Marquis I was a bit unsure about this location due to the possibility of noise. We had a room on the 30th floor. It was very quiet and we have no complaints. Everything exceeded our expectations. The only negative would be that it took more time that it should have at check in.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
#4 Hotel in Los Angeles??? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights. Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms. Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like. The carpeting was stained, there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub. Granted the location is good, however if I knew that the rooms looked like this I would have gone to the Roosevelt.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Smiley's Restaurant We didn't stay at the hotel, but ate at the attached restaurant. It was, by far, the best meal we had in Rincon. The atmosphere is very romantic and the service was great.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more romantic night out.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
BE Careful Hotel was OK, had problem with room, lack of water (Hot  Cold) also had small ant infestation. Hotel opened up resources to outsiders on weekends, so you spent your time waiting to be served or dodging children in pools. Also observed staff taking cutlery from one dining table which just finished and placing it on another, not too hygenic, made sure to wash utensils before using. Hotel and staff very pleasant. Hotel was rated when I went as a 4 Star, to me it is 2 Star at best.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative']]
Perfect for Family Reunion and 30th Absolutely loved this hotel. The staff were friendly, the rooms were superb, location was fantastic and the free wine is a nice touch.

Great location I stayed in this hotel in jan 2007 for three nights, you could not wish for a better location, everything is within reasonable walking distance and for those who don't like to walk there is a tram stop directly outside the hotel. my room was small but clean with tv and tea + coffee making facilities and a safe big enough for a laptop. The bathroom was fine with a good shower. I did not eat in the restaurant as their is plenty of choice in amsterdam, the bar is expensive but a pleasant enough place to meet up or finnish the night.

Good location, passive-agressive service The location is terrific - a block from cable car, 2 blocks from Union Square. The room is well decorated, though noisy and on a small side. Upstairs concierge(s) do not say hello, used the speaker phone to talk to the returns department at Macy's (spare me!) my request for missing newspaper was answered with it'll get here.

John And Nessie on Our Honeymoon We arrived Tuesday afternoon on our honeymoon to be greeted by very friendly staff, we had lovely fresh fruit brought to the room on arrival,we asked to change the room for one where we could see and hear the sea,no problem,very helpfull. The beach is supurb (Like the bounty advert) lovely warm sea,very safe to wonder around,plenty of sun loungers,and parasoles for shade,the food is very good plenty of choice, breezes is a very clean and kept clean hotel the staff are very pleasent and very helpful,We would recommend taking a box of PG tips and a couple of bars of Cadburys and any other required pleasures, that can't be bought out there,you will be ripped off buying things in the hotel. The country side is very plush and green breath taking scenery and well worth taking an excursion out and experiencing the local culture.

worth the price! We stayed at the Ritz Millenia for 5 days in Sep 06. Their staff were super friendly - and made all the arrangements we asked for.

Q We booked a four-night airfare/hotel package with Expedia,choosing the QC because of the mostly positive reviewson TripAdvisor.com, which turned out to be accurate. TheQ C will not knock your socks off, but it covers the basicbases handily: with a pleasant, clean room and a few pleasing extras like Bath and Body Works toiletries, a second magnifying mirror in the bathroom, etc. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. One drawback: we were put in the second building next door on Camp Street, and the room had permanently-sealed windows of frosted, pebbled glass -- gave kind of a claustrophobic effect.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
great hotel loved this hotel. centrally located, great price, nice size room, quiet, great shutters that shut out all the light so you can siesta during the day. only minor complaint is that the temperature of the water varies when you shower. i think if someone on the floor above you flushes the toilet or something the water temp in the shower first gets really hot then cold before it returns to the temp I had set. really minor complaint though. this hotel was great.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]

A sanctuary amongst inferior hotels After a horrific experience at the LaFayette hotel down the street, my coworker and I went back to the familiar comfort of the Marriott. We were greeted by very friendly doormen and someone came and took our luggage that we had to carry up the street in the rain. In fact, they were so nice that when I tripped over a drain cover that was in the parking lot, the doorman immediately went and got a screwdriver and fastened the cover to the ground! The desk workers were equally friendly and put us in a great room. It may not seem like much, but it's the small things that make a stay incredible, and this one definitely was worthy of the marriott name!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

we loved this hotel I stayed at estherea with my husband and my daughter (who was 9 mths old at that time) in december 2005. i write this review only now because I want to recommend this beautiful hotel which we loved very much. We had a lovely canal view room at the last floor, very romantic. Really tremendous view!Wonderful location, in the very centre of amsterdam. Staff not particularly friendly. Very nice hotel anyway!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Very Good Stayed here for business in Brooklyn, the location was great, just a block from where I was working. Overall a great hotel, well maintained and very clean (especially when compared to previous experiences in 'upscale' Manhattan hotels).Food was very good, and restaurant/bar staff friendly. My only issue was with the noise from the adjacent room that came through the connecting door. This seems to be a common problem with Marriotts, in my experience (maybe with all hotels as well, but I stay almost exclusively at Marriotts.) A fussy toddler kept me awake until 1:30AM, ugh. Beautiful views from the Concierge Lounge, and presumably from bridge-view rooms.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Artus is Great for Romance We stayed at the Artus for just one night and booked the junior suite. It was fabulous, newly refurbished with a great bathroom and balcony overlooking the rooftops of Paris. The hotel is in an good location and Sanjay gave us an excellent recomendation for dinner and was very helpful throughout. Highly recommended!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and although we did have some minor troubles (check in delayed by half an hour, water pressure) the staff of the hotel and the manager in particular demonstrated great understanding and excellent customer service. Interiors are very well designed, minimal being the key word. I'd go back there as the location is perfect, we walked everywhere and didn't need to take the tube at all! One highlight: the breakfast! Eating out in Barcelona can be pretty pricey so the huge buffet with savory and sweet choices, cooked brekfast with tortillas, eggs, bacon, etc is definitely worth it!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
A Very Good Hotel at a Very Good Price This was a very good surprise in Madrid: The rate was extremely good (90 euros/night, booked about 2 months in advance); included internet, minibar complimentary; was Exceptionally Clean; Recently renovated; Quiet; Well located (short cab ride or walk to Prado in one direction; Mayor Square in the other); very friendly. I was extremely happy with this hotel and would recommend it if you're looking for a smaller hotel that is quiet and well located. Note, it did not have exercise facilities and the on site restaurant was pricey; however, eating options were readily available at a number of restaurants within 1 to 3 minute walk.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Perfect Madrid Accommodation My friend and I stayed at Cruz Sol in July after having made an internet booking months in advance. When our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hostal at 2am, we were welcomed in and shown to our room which was exactly as stated on their website. The rooms were clean and secure with extra conveniences such as a hair dryer, safe, patio and a decent sized bathroom. Very central location with fabulous bars and restaurants nearby. Very affordable accommodation -would recommend it to anyone!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Total incompetence The staff at this hotel all of the way up the manager are totally, totally incompetent, definitely stay away! My initial reservation was totally botched by someone who sounded like a teenager answering the phones. Then when I called to cancel my reservation I discovered that the mistake had never been fixed. Even worse yet, despite cancelling, my credit card was still billed and after 6 calls and several e-mails to the hotel, including Leah the manager I was never responded to!! I have never never had an experience like this at any hotel in my life!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Sufficient I wouldn't necessarily go back to the Hostal R. Capitol, as I found it a bit old and crumbly for my taste, but it has a couple of redeeming qualities: First, it is located right on the Ramblas, and there's hardly a more perfect location for those who enjoy bustling activity in their immediate environs. Second, I was extremely grateful that I was able to book the room shortly before 10:30 on a Friday night, arrive about an hour later ... and check out around 5:30 the following morning. The helpful gentleman at the front desk, on duty all night long, was undaunted by the unusual (but, in my case, necessary) hours. In short, this would not be my first choice for Barcelona accomodations, but if you need an inexpensive room in a pinch, Hostal R. Capitol suffices.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
A great value right next to the French Quarter I needed an alternate hotel near the Sheraton on Canal, where I was attending a conference. I found the Country Inn  Suites on Magazine Street to be reasonably priced, clean and convenient in location to my conference and to the French Quarter. The rooms are small, but the building is architecturally interesting as a combination of three older buildings that were remodeled into a hotel. The free breakfast buffet has a good selection as well. Overall, a good buy!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Expensive, Run down, Dirty This hotel does not match the pictures shown on the hotel website. The rooms are not clean and need to be renovated. The bathrooms are filthy, so if you stay here, bring disinfectant with you. The furnishings are old and run down.

Great location My husband and i have just spent three nights in this hotel. It is ideally situated to see all the main sights as it is right across the street from the train station and under ground, which I must say we found to be brilliant as they all seem to arrive on time. The hotel and the rooms are very clean. The staff are friendly and the concierge are excellent for information about the best way to get to sights. All in all an excellent trip and I would have no hesitation on recommending this hotel.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Neither Here Nor There Clean, efficient, but rather soulless hotel. No views to speak of, other than the port (fascinating though it is) on one side. Service is fine, gym is compact but adequate.

a little too isolated down 12-25 back 1-1-04 loved the resort, the buffets as good as the al a cartes. A little too isolated to get off the resort.

Majestic! Stayed here for 2 nights last Dec. 22, '08. We were given a room at the 32nd floor of the Imperial Tower with the view of Ginza.

Will always return... I have stayed here a number of times (for weeks at a time) and have had not only superior service but excellent accomodations.

great location, great service thanks to trip advisor for recommending this place. it was really close to all amenities that san francisco has to offer. the apartment worked out really well, having the space of an apartment, but the feel of a hotel. i would definately recommend anyone to stay here, staff were great too. views from the 14th floor were fantastic!! thanks once more.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. Our room was a really good size and very comfortable. Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee, it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10:30am. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs, bacon, toast etc. We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

Great central location Good room, very good bed, nice bathroom, great breakfast. Location is top: right within main shopping area, within walking distance to forbidden city, tianmen square etc. Friendly, helpful and competent concierge-team. We were very happy with our choice.

Excellent AB Viladomat Having just spent four nights at the hotel AB Viladomat I can highly recomend it as a clean good value and very pleasant place to spend a few days. The staff were all very friendly and helpful I would have great difficulty in faulting the hotel at all, it is a little way away from the city centre but the public transport is so simple to use that it is not a problem. The main tourist spots are within a twenty minute walk. I would certainly use the AB Viladomat if I were to travel to Barcelona again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral']]
Over rated For the price you pay, make sure you get one of the better rooms. When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade (basically all the cars going up can see you). I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later, I got the one I wanted, with a bit of a view for the same price. There's nothing extraordinary about this hotel, the gym is quaint, the rooms are small, the bathroom is actually really big, it was about 1/2 the size of the bedroom... the restaurant is pretty cool.####[['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Good for Marathoners Stayed here for the Marathon weekend, like they said it's not a great neighbourhood but you can't beat the price, parking is free, and the complimentary breakfast is what you need. The free shuttle bus worked well most of the time, we used it to get to the subway. They even made sure it was good to go for us marathon morning. I get the feeling they don't overpay the staff...........####[['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'neutral'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
lose to perfection I stayed in the Royal Park for 4 weeks on a lengthy business trip. In short, this is probably the finest business hotel I have ever stayed in. A few of the things I loved: a nicely decorated, spacious room; a PC with free internet access (in the room); a metro station directly under the hotel; a nice selection of glasses in the room (tall, tumbler, wine etc.); great food from the many hotel restaurants; a wide range of toiletries; a fantastic shower; free use of a DVD playeror BOSE music system on request; 8 types of pillow to choose from (!) and finally, impeccable service from all the staff. If you are planning a trip to Tokyo, for business or pleasure, bypass all the obvious chain hotels and give this little gem a try.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
5 star hotel with historic charm Stayed for one night and was really impressed.

Terrible elevator... The room was fine as well as the location of the hotel (not too far from city centre). However, there were 2 big problems disappointing me: noise on the outside and a constant beeping from the elevator door throughout the night whenever the door opened.

Loved the valentine special offerings I normally do not stay in Dutch hotels as my job puts me up in enough hotels abroad. However my boyfriend treated me to a valentine weekend in Amsterdam.

Just near the hotel is a money exchange dealer who gave us a good deal for our U.S. dollars.

Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years. An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff. Great location in Midtown on the East Side, close to restaurants, shopping and an easy walk, cab or subway ride to museums. Highly recommended especially if you can find a good deal online either through the hotel itself or an online travel agency. My only complaint is the high prices for room service and still a $10 per day charge for high speed internet.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
average at best This hotel has a good location, but not a lot else, it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room, including giving us the key to an occupied room, and keys that did not work. We were then allegedly upgraded, from what I cannot imagine, the room was tiny, and not air conditioned. The continental breakfast was a complete farce, a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom, which had then to be carried back to the bedroom, where there was no where to eat but on the bed. The staff apart from the initial difficulties were pleasant and helpfull, and the hotel seemed clean.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Nice hotel, uninteresting location This hotel itself and the staff are very adequate but being located in downtown Miami is a hinderance. It is far from the beaches and its pool and health facilities are very small, considering it is in Florida. The surrounding area is undergoing a great deal of building and renovation so currently it is noisy; I am sure it will improve in the next few years. Overall a good hotel for business meetings but not for vacationers.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Nice Place I satyed four nights at the hotel for a conference and found it to be a fine establishment. I was in a distant section that made access to the lobby and conference section quite a hike but was near to the spa and pool which proved to be an advantage.

clean but small rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, but very tiny and dated interiors. elevators are small and slow. location is ideal for shopping in union square area. would stay again, but would try to get a better price. parking is very expensive and tax is added to parking fee. overall average rating is about all this deserved.####[['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Great Hotel I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and knowing it score #5 hotel in Toronto and I must say it deserve the high ratings, large rooms with kitchen, free sauna and gym on the top and great location, just 10 min walk to union Station and CN tower. Don't expect to view the skyline as the hotel is not very tall and it's surrounded by offices.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Decent balance of cost/location/quality The location is great. The rooms are motel like, but sport great views of the city, especially at sunset and dawn. Don't expect great service, though it is not the worst. Comfortable, respectable, a good value in LA.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'neutral']]

Great place to My grandson, daughter, sister and myself spent five nights at the hotel, we were on the second floor inside room and loved the quiet of the room, we can not said enough good things about this hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We ate in the restuarnt and enjoyed the food. It was within distance of the sites we were interested in and begining close to the wharf was great. Any return trips we will stay at the Argonaut.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
The staff make this hotel truly awesome! We decided to visit the wonderful island of Bali for our Honeymoon in October and after scouring the internet for the best all inclusive resorts there chose to stay at the Melia Benoa hotel. The staff at the hotel were simply superb; Mendrin, Pardi and Augustini were the highlights providing service with a smile 24/7! Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front, with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants. Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options, imported spirits, late check out and free laundry service!Also had a good tour of the island with Wayan - recommended although don't forget to take extra cash to buy souvenirs and to get into the tourist attractions!####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
agree with "do not stay here" This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn't give it two. A hint to future guests: if you have a problem, it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations. They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it. They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns. Save yourself the pain and get yourself a real four star hotel and stay at the Best Western down the street.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Great Small Hotel This is a great small hotel. The beds are very comfortable and it located with a park on one side of the hotel and the beach a few steps from the other side. I would recommend this if you done want to stay a one of the big hotels and if you want great customer service. I found it to be a very relaxing hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Lovely boutique hotel The Hotel Ares Eiffel was renovated a few months ago and has been done very tastefully. Some of the previous reviewer photos are a bit old and not at all representative of the current state. The room we stayed in (executive) was very nice. It's reasonably expensive but bearing in mind the location and that this is Paris, probably about right. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a very nice boutique hotel!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great experience! The new remodeled rooms are very beautiful and comfortable. New ammenities like bigger closet and sofa to watch TV where totally unexpected for me.

One more great experience Spent three nights here in early May. I just read the last few reviews and see no point in repeating what others have eloquently said already. I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth and say that this is a wonderful hotel that reflects its city. Well worth the expense.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Superb hotel We went to Berlin for the Xmas markets and decided to stay at this hotel because of the very good feedback reviews on tripadvisor. For the money, it is one of the best European hotels that we have stayed in - we were surprised at how large the rooms were. It is also ideally situated and in very quiet street. The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was not included in the price but we found a small cafe just around the corner where we could purchase rolls, sandwiches, croissants etc at a fraction of the price that the breakfast in the hotel would have cost. Thoroughly recommended - you won't be disappointed.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Stylish and great staff I stayed at the Hotel Globus in May 2005 as a single female traveller. The room was small but very stylish and spotless. The staff were all fantastic and very friendly. Good breakfast and excellent location for the railway station and easy reach of all Florence's attractions. I'm going back to Florence in December and will be staying there again.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Recent Upgrade I stay at this hotel regularly for business and pleasure. It is in a great location, right next to Chinatown, across the road from the Sydney Entertainment Centre and a short walk from Darling Harbour. They have recently renovated their bar/bistro and have also started to upgrade rooms. While it is not in the most glamorous part of the city it is well worth a visit.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Nice Location, Cute Decor I stayed here for a business covention. The property is unique, cute and trendy. The rooms are little dark, but other than that it was a nice stay. It was centrally located so we could walk to everywhere we needed to get to. I would definitely stay here again on a return trip. Try Le Phare bar down the street, nice spot for drinks.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral']]
As expected Efficient and friendly check in, simple swipe of the credit card as expected. The room was lovely, recently refurbished, very comfy beds. Bathroom was large  clean, although it was a bit dark even with all the lights on so a bit hard to put make up on!I didn't get to try the breakfast so can't comment there.

Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora - Spend your money elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora this week (departed 16/8/06). The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling. We realised that the breakfast charges of 330,000 R for breakfast for two was way over the top, and started visiting outside the resort. Everything works, it鈥檚 all nice, but it feels like nobody鈥檚 there, and its not fun.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii. It was definitely impressive, though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare. Still, it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos. My hotel room had what I'd call a partial ocean view, you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view. I was suprised at how noisy the street below me was, even on the 26th floor, I heard even car horn, every screaming baby, every yelling partier on the street, all night long.####[['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Good FQ option We had a very nice night at the Monteleone. The location is excellent and the room was clean and quiet. We did not have a view but we slept like rocks. I prefer a quiet room over one with a window on the French Quarter street noise. If you call thirty mintues before needing your car it should be there for you.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Fantastic Bang For the Buck I found the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour to be a bargain compared to other hotels in Sydney. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Factor in the friendly staff and good location with a very reasonable price and you have a smart selection for the budget traveller (but not too budget!).Lots of tourist sites, a plethora of restaurants and shopping areas within walking distance from this hotel. This is a solid choice for those who don鈥檛 need a four-star accommodation, but still want a well-kept, comfortable and centrally-located hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

Stayed at the Kimberly June 24-27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr, 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6. They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable, pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location, nice doormen, and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we'd stay again -####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'negative']]
Disappointing Husband and I had a one night stopover in Singapore en route to London from Australia. Expedia recommended this hotel as a 'good deal'. It was certainly well-located, in the heart of the shopping district, but the hotel was run down and the room frankly shabby with threadbare carpets and beaten up furnature. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, the staff barely understood English. Not recommended unless you really do get it at bargain price, which we did not.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Recommended by a fussy pair! My friend and I stayed in Room 273 and found it to be clean and comfortable. Sheets and towels changed daily, room was sufficient size with tea making facilities replenished each day, breakfast was simple but very edible and the staff, although we didn't require much, were helpful! Internet access available, storage for baggage, definately would stay here again and worth the money. Located on a quiet street beside Vondelpark, PC Hoovestraat, with great shopping and trams.

ok if you like one place our family (son 12 )stayed at the dominicana for 2 weeks from 27th july, just to say ive been to DR now and won't return, the hotel facilities are execellent the grounds well maintained, the rooms fine, with clean bedding towels etc whenever needed. The food is ok but repetitive especially if you are staying for 14 days like we were. Entertainement was poor, nothing really jumped out to us and as an English family our son was bored to death as her had nothing to do, and most of the other guests were none english a lot of spanish, french usa.the beach and pool areas are fantastic no complaints there, like a lot of other people we had upset stomachs and my son was ill in bed on arriving home for 2 days Dont know were the problem lies as we were always careful with what we ate and drank.would be fine for a week but 2 weeks confined in one place is not for m####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Excellent service I stayed at the Radisson as one of a group of 40 that travelled to Boston for the St. Patricks day parade. I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel facillities are really good, including on site swimming pool, rooms are above average size, excellent beds, spotlessly clean, restaurant is well above average and hotel is very centrally located and convienient to airport (12 mins by cab) The reservations dept were extremely helpful throughout and were not in the least fazed by the inevitable changes to bookings that is inherrent in a large group. In short, highly recommended and would definately stay there again when in Boston.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]

Excellent service. We stayed for 5 days during Christmas vacation, 2005. There were 6 of us; 2 seniors, 2 adults and 2 children, and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. While the building is older, worn, and was never fancy to begin with; the rooms are big, comfortable, and in a perfect location. The service we received from the entire staff was very friendly and the best customer service any of us had ever experienced. I told the staff that I would post a positive review here and on cruise critic as a way of saying thank you.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
good location, but unorganised Stayed at the hotel Carlton for 1 week in october. The price was reasonable, however we stayed in 3 rooms in that week. We wanted 2 singles, but for 2 nights they were 'unavailable' so we were moved around rooms with double beds. On one occasion there was a couple at reception complaining that they had 2 single beds when they wanted a double, but we were unable to swap with them. Apart from the trouble with the rooms, the location was fantastic, only a quick walk to union square and the staff were polite and helpful.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
They charge for EVERYTHING! The hotel it's self is bautiful, very elegant and in an amazing location, plus if you get a ramblas view, your stay will be very memorable, however, they charge a fortune for everything. We had coffee in our room but no kttle, so you ask for hot water which they brought up, but I also asked for milk in my coffee (no UHT in the room) 6 Euro's! 6 Euro's for milk in my coffee!!!!####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Fabulous top class hotel We stayed for 3 nights here, in between visiting Kuala Lumpur then Pengang ~ without a shadow of a doubt this was the best part of the trip. We could not fault the hotel, the location was great, the staff superb and the rooms absolutely wonderful, very spacious and the most wonderful bathrooms. I was suprised about other reviews commenting on the pool, we were delighted with the pool and the wonderful towels provided, especially as this is a City hotel.

When I arrived to the hotel, 2 hours later, they told me that they had no free rooms since the day before.

A nice, affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona, but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price. Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord, you can't stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona's top sights. Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street. Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room, and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early (9:30ish) in the morning. Otherwise, this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Nice Hotel, Nice Location, A Little Dated Stayed here for two nights in February. Was a nice hotel, with great views, but the rooms felt small and older. I'd suggest requesting the newer tower (there are two towers to the hotel) when booking. Overall, a nice property, but not worth more than $160ish per night in my opinion. I'd look around and see what else is out there, if the rate is exceeding $160ish.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Disappointing and watch the final bill I've stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated (given the price) I've returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it. I wouldn't return to The Clift; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge/front door staff are all good but that's about it. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen (and I had a loft suite) - and for the price other hotels offer more (no flat screen TV, ineffective air con). What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US$185 for late checkout without any notification (I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11.00am). E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
More than adequate for its class We stayed in the Monna Lisa for 4 nights in early December and had a positive experience. This is not a luxury hotel, but given the price we had no complaints. The street is a quiet one and the location, near the Duomo and on the same street as La Giostra Restaurant is very convenient. Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with, graciously providing information and making reservations for us for dinners and tours.

The service was courteous  professional, the rooms were large by european standards and very well appointed. The grounds of the hotel were elegant yet unpretentious.

I really enjoyed the location, the hotel is great (nice lobby, stylish rooms, good concierge service, etc). The only thing I didn't like (while staying at the 12th floor) is the view - there was none - only a back street.

Not your average hotel room I've stayed at this hotel twice, the first time with a group of girls for our friend's bachelorette party. The location was great, the staff was fine (though, admittedly, we were not that demanding of them), and the suite was huge. Also, we like the '50s/'60s-era feel and the fact that we weren't in another cookie-cutter chain. The location is also wonderful. I look forward to my next trip back to the Magic Castle.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Very Bad Service This hotel has the worst service. Even though it is in near downtown I would strongly suggest you stay somewhere else where they treat you with respectful service. The price is cheap and thats the service you will get.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Best Service at any Four Seasons Having stayed in many Four Seasons Hotels (married in one) this location is tops in service! Location is just a few (flat) blocks to Union Square, cable cars, museums, and Moscone Convention Center. I have stayed there many times and never had a single bad experience. If you are looking for a SF property you cannot go wrong with this hotel.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
The best hotel and location in Barcelona Amazing place to stay-no need to look elsewhere. If you're young and you like to be in a cool neighbourhood with lots to do, this is your playground. Ask for the rooms overlooking the Ramblas. Just Book It!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great location The hotel is very charming and takes on the modern architectural feel of Barcelona. The room itself is small, and leave a good deal to be desired. However, the enormous balcony we had and the modern bathroom did balance that out. The restaurant was very good. The location is in a very central and safe neighborhood, and allowed us to easily walk to most attractions.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['polarity positive', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Great Hotel The hotel was very clean, comfortable and in a superb location right in the centre of Amsterdam(Dam Sq/Red Light). We had a triple room which worked out a 拢90 a night between us which is great value. Would definitely recommend this hotel for young couples and groups.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
ideal location excellent location, not knowing the city, we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area, pier 39 , the deals, alcatraz. The hotel was very plush inside, staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile. Our room was fantatic, modern clean and decorated to a very high standard. The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn't get to appreciate the facilities. Would suggest this hotel used if time to be spent relaxing within the hotel, if a hotel needed to use as a base for sightseeing then maybe this one is a little too expensive.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]
2 stars with 5 stars service what more can i say about this place that has not been said already. It felt like a home away from home not just a hotel. The owners make you feel really welcomed and give you a feeling that you have known them for years. The best part of all was the friendlyness of staff which is so hard to find in some hotels. Europa is a must for all travellers.####[['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
great value - in der mitte just returned from a two night stay at the mercure - a very unpromising facade, but don't let that put you off! We payed around 70 euro a night - and i was pleasently surprised. We had an enormous room, big comfy kingsize bed and a great shower. Couldn't ask for anymore really, about a 20 minute stroll to mitte and hackescher markt. A good value base in Berlin.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Best Kept Secret in Seattle ! This is the best kept secret in Seattle. We were expecting the typical Best Western hotel. This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in for many years. The staff is marvelous !####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Fantastic!!!!! Went to this hotel for Valentines weekend, as soon as we arrived we were very impressed as they upgraded us for Free!. The hotel is fantastic and very clean. The staff at the hotel were always very helpful and friendly. This hotel is in a perfect location, and what better way to enjoy it than to go back for a swim and sauna at the end of a busy day. While you are in Paris I would definately recommend going for a meal along the River Seine, and also a meal in the Pavillion Elysee restaurant (along the champse elysee).When I visit Paris again I will stay here again!!!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Fit for purpose We stayed here for 1 night as we were flying out the next morning at 6am and everything about the hotel was fine. The room was clean, bathroom was a decent size, and there was free wifi internet which is always a bonus.

Think the HI is getting a bad rap I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of April. My room was spotless (despite what some reviewers have written), and while the bathroom was small, the shower itself was roomy, the hotel bath linens of very good quality and a working iron and ironing board in the closet. The staff was very friendly, very helpful and willing to work with a little Spanglish if communication broke down. I, for one, like not being in a property facing Ashford (it was much quieter) and still less than a block from everything on Ashford. Breakfast every AM in a room facing the pool (which only gets sun in the AM BTW) was good with pastries, juice and coffee. All in all, more than I expected from a Holiday Inn at a reasonable prepurchase rate.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Encapsulates the heart of Florence We spent a few days here at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have picked a nicer spot. We fell in love with Florence and also with this hotel which, for us, encapsulated the heart of this beautiful city with its relaxed elegance and warm spirit. We had a very 'Florentine' room with a view' and a great bed, the best of friendly attention from our hosts, a good breakfast and a super location. In the grim early- winter days which are fast enveloping the North of Ireland, we think about our 'time out' in this little Florentine idyll all the time and hope some day to return. Thanks for everything.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Great find - family hotel in the heart of New York City Found this hotel quite by accident and what a find... Location is just off times square - right in the middle of the action. Hotel is themed on North African theme and it completely works, the friendly attentitive staff actually seem to care about your well being and you don't feel as though you are a corporate number. In particular the free cheese and wine every evening helps to make you night out complete, they do this because they don't (didn't) have a liquor licence.breakfast is continental style - but again included in the price. The rooms are big (for New York) and a welcome change from the chain hotels - with fans as well as the usual AC. The only downside was leaving - great place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Nice but noisy Location is the problem here. Didn't feel safe to walk outside but the front desk got cabs with ease. Very noisy outside, double glazing would help. Room excellent, staff excellent, facilities excellent, restaurant/bar excellent, reasonably priced, shuttle to airport excellent.

Fantastic Hotel Hotel Johann is a really great hotel - the breakfast is fantastic, the rooms are clean and modern and a great size with fab bathrooms. It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin (its very cheap, efficient and easy to navigate) but the area was no problem - I guess it's worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are. I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price, venue and facilities (breakfast, spa, small bar, minibar, bikes available and outside seating). Stay here!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
great stay We spent one night at this hotel after reading several reviews that were not so good. Worried about the hotel and the neighborhood after a car break in comment, I am happy to say that our stay was wonderful, the surrounding area around the hotel was nice, and the whole stay was great. We have nothing bad to say about this hotel. We frequently stay at holiday inns and this was a nice one.####[['hotel general', 'positive']]
peace in a great location We spent two nights here last weekend and it lived up to all of this site's positive reviews. The bed and room were small but wonderful and so quiet. The service was personal and excellent. And you step outside the door and can easily walk to great restaurants, theater, bars, and shopping. This is a wonderful find.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel. When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip, we got a cancellation number. A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
really liked it We stayed in December just for 1 night, but I liked the location, the room (great bed) and the staff. The restaurant was very good. It is joined by the skyway to 2 rather pricey malls, but is was good not to have to go outside to shop. Legal Seafood is in the mall, Yummy! I would stay again in the summer as it is not far from Fenway and lots to see walking around.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

LOVE it ! LOVE IT ! I was surprised by this apartment. I booked a three night special rate bedroom, and the apartment is better than my expectation.

Staff is wonderful!!! My wife and I stayed at this hotel back in December for 3 nights. A great location if you're there to see the city at Christmas time.

I would definitely stay there again.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Highly Recommend Had a great time staying here, the staff were super friendly from the minute we arrived. Very clean hotel and rooms located extremely close to Union Square and even had a starbuck attached to the building. Also close to car hire firms and main shopping area. Concierge also had greeat locval knowledge or resturants and shops. I would recommend  We loved it We had a great time there.

fabulous! We arrived at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne with high expectations, which could have really set us up for a disappointment. Fortunately, we were even more impressed than we thought we would be. The staff was very helpful, always smiling, and the room was wonderfully clean, with a distant view of the Sacre Coeur from the balcony (on the fourth floor). It is close to the pyramides metro station, so it's easy to navigate the city from its location. I'm not sure that I will choose a pricier hotel in Paris, because this hotel has so much to offer--all the more reason to splurge on some fantastic French food!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Back again! On our trip through Mexico we stayed three nights at the NH Hotel Mexico City. Everything was excellent: a very clean and calm room (on the ninth floor), with all comfort you can imagine (till toothbrushes, toothpaste, wax for shoes, ...), the breakfast buffet was tremendous and the staff was friendly and competent (spoke even french!). We felt that in this hotel all is made so that the customer feelshimself well.

Almost luxury in the middle of the French Quarter The Omni is a very nice hotel, refreshing change from the norm in the middle of the French Quarter. The rooms are comfortable and if you want lots of space request a King corner room, I could've swim laps in the bathtub.

Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam. We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer. The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden, which was perfectly nice and quiet. Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East, for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional, something you don't see everywhere. Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well (which we didnt join since we had other plans).Staff, especially porters and concierge, were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans, which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay. All in all, the location can't be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff, Pulitzer gets a thumb up!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Beautiful and quiet The Library is a beautiful, clean, lovely hotel in a great location. The staff from arrival until we left 4 days later were attentive, knowledgable, and helpful. The rooms are numbered with the Dewey Decimal System and each room has a little theme (ours was a the ancient language room) and they are tastefully decorated to create a calm inviting setting. They have complementary breakfast, drinks and snacks through out the day, complimentary wine and cheese daily, a rooftop bar, streetlevel resturaunt, oncall doctor, free movie rentals, and are within walking distance to 5th Avenue shopping, Grand Central Station, and St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Like a spacious apartment Our room at the Lenox was enormous. It was a perfect oasis to return to each night, with a huge bathroom and a separate closet room. Staff were excellent and friendly and the location was perfect, being close to Newberry Street and Boylston Street shops and restaurants. The king size bed did slope into the middle a little, but we still found it comfortable. Strongly recommended.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive']]
Pleasantly surprised! I stayed here over a weekend and paid a ridicously low rate, so I wasn't expecting much. The concierge was very helpful and the beautiful hotel bar is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine and listen to piano, or later in the night, the jazz quartet. My room was very large, my only complaint is the plumbing is still very old (it took a long time for the hot water). Otherwise this place is a gem and a nice change of pace from the cookie-cutter chains.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]

Good Hotel is at good location to shops and foods. The hotel staff were fantastic, friendly, informative and helpful all the time.

IDEAL for large groups. Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30's and 40's. Found it to be a good quality ,well run, clean hotel. Staff were all very curteous and welcoming (even when returning from nights out at 5.30AM) and rooms were clean and adequate. Didn't sample the food - plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars within 50 yards. Steps to (excellent) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport (get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T-10 ticket that allows 10 journeys).Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro's a day is a bit stiff.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
zy This hotel may appear old and run down from the outside but I found it quant, clean, and roomy on the inside. I rented a room that had a bathroom. The room had room and even though the building was older it was clean. The was location was great, (2 blocks from Pikes Place).I stayed for 3 nights. My only complaints were thin walls, (you could hear chatter next door even when others were using speaking voices), and one night were the neighbors liked to party late.####[['hotel design_features', 'neutral'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Sweet and over the top and worth it This is a small place, close to what you will want to see, even for old hats of Paris. The staff will speak English if you do and will speak French if you do, even if you speak poorly. The Amex bill will floor you on return, but there is no better place to stay in Paris.

Great hotel for a city break We stayed at the Residence Inn from 6-10 June 2008 for 4 nights. We had a 2 bed suite on the 14th floor which had everything you need even had large dishwasher and a huge fridge/freezer which came in handy for ice cream as there was an heatwave on whilst we were there. Could not fault it at all. Hotel is in a great location, plenty of resturants nearby , not too far to the train station. I think this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when doing a city break. Would definately recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

wonderful hotel We stayed for 4 nights at the Argonaut - our second stay here. The hotel's location at the end of Fisherman's Wharf and almost next to Ghirardelli Square is just about perfect for vacationing travelers - very convenient, yet quiet. Service is excellent, beds are extremely comfortable, and rooms are well decorated and clean. The hotel's restaurant, Blue Mermaid, is very good (although we liked Capurro's across the street better for breakfast). The bowls of fruit in the lobby and the wine hour in the afternoon are great added touches that make you feel good that you decided to stay there.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Hated the Ariele in Florence, Tuscany Two of three concierges in this hotel were incredibly rudeand surly. My son had the room in his name but eventhough his two traveling companions had their passports,they could not get into their room until he arrived in the evening. The room had already been paid for through a travel agent. The hotel's shower curtains were moldy and it was outof the way which made taking a taxi to and from the hotelnecessary. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]

An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us. It was great to be able to walk off the Ramblas straight into the hotel, where peace and tranquillity was the order. The staff were both courteous and efficient and the bar service was excellent. Some may consider the rooms on the small side, but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair, you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer. I have recommended the hotel to both family and friends and will definately stay here again on our next visit.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict']]

Be aware that it will cost $30 to park your car, even if you self-park.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Brilliant Hotel Thanks for the great ideas I got from your site - we had a brilliant holiday in the U.S. I've travelled extensively over the past 35 years and lived in 6 countries - the Omni in Frisco is my new favourite hotel- it was worth every penny - they got the little things so right and were charming and helpful hosts - the room was spotless and well appointed and the location is good. Really - I was so impressed I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else ( and it's not just for oldies my teenage daughter was also impressed)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Stayed 1 night Only one thing to say Ask your rep for a move to a 5* Hotel. Take no excuses  get out. Thats what I did and I ended up in a much better hotel in Bavaro with a view from my room overlooking the whole of Bavaro bay - a view to die for.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Good location but small rooms Good location right next to all the shops in the centre of San Farn. The rooms were good but a on the small side. I would stay again but i might search to see if there are more reasonably priced hotels with the same facilities. Main bonus was the swimming pool... lovely break from a hot city!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Not a bad pllace to stay We needed a fairly inexpensive place near the Quarter and found the Courtyard. We arrived not knowing what to expect. While it was not luxurious it was clean, the pool/courtyard area were fantastic and easy to get to, and the staff was friendly and bent over backwards to help make our stay enjoyable. No matter where your room is, you are close to street level and traffic could be noisy at night. The continental breakfast was small, but it was available all morning long and the coffee was great! While it's not the Ritz, it's not a bad place to stay.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Terrific Location We stayed at this hotel on our first 4 nights in Australia. The view of Darling Harbour from the room was amazing. The hotel room was excellent in everyway. The location to transport, the harbour, bars, restaurants and ferries couldn't have been better. A lot of business people use this hotel but tourists are made very welcome by the friendly and courteous staff. I would certainly stay here again on my next visit to Sydney.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Good Value and Great Location I was looking for a clean and pleasant hotel in a central location and this really fits the bill. The modernisation has ben done thoughtfully with old features retained but clean, spacious modern rooms. The staff were helpful and the hotel was great as a base to explore the city. I did not eat in the hotel - there were too many tempting local restaurants nearby - but the bar was stylish and welcoming. The rate charged seemed to me to offer very good value indeed for the quality of the service provided.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

isy, noisy There was construction going on just outside my window and it was very noisy. When I checked out, the staff accused me of trying to skimp on minibar purchases.

Great hotel, but not so great location The hotel is very modern, with an air of trendiness, the furniture is new and very nice, the bathroom is large, well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny. On the other hand, some things are a little kitchy, like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room (first I thought it's parquet), the breakfast is really poor, the parking a little too expensive (15 euros a day) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying. The hotel is near the train station, but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room. Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls. It takes about 15 minutes to the center.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Room Inadaquate I was assigned a room which was located directly next to the elevator shaft.....

Great location, terrible rooms! The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. It is just around the corner from Nathan Street which is ideal for any shopaholics and there is an underground station a minute鈥檚 walk away from the hotel. The Kowloon Hotel is a very busy hotel which caters for business people and tourists alike. As I say the location is excellent but the rooms are just tiny and not particularly pleasurable to be in either I鈥檓 afraid. However, if you don鈥檛 plan to be in the room much and are looking for somewhere central to explore Hong Kong (as we were) and without forking out a small fortune for a more exclusive hotel, then this hotel is worth considering.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Great Hotel Consistent Service, Not a Good Location Have stayed here a few times for business, and this hotel never disappoints. courtyard, pool and spa are an oasis in this concrete jungle. Rooms area clean and consistent and up to four seasons standards. Hotel not located in the best area of the city, and I would not recommend walking outside, even though there is a park closeby. Hotel is located in an area with alot of one way stalled traffic, so a real pain to get in and out of the hotel if you are trying to get to meetings or the airport to catch a flight.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Great Deal! Got a great deal at the Marinna Inn. The location was nice, the hotel clean, friendly and problem free.

Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest. Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty. Hair in sink and bath was off putting. Best measure of (lack of) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window. We were told someone would clean, then they would clean next day - needless to say it remained uncleaned on check out two days later. Location only good point.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Once is enough If this is a 5-star hotel, I'm a monkey's uncle! I'll give it 3-stars on a good day. The rooms are dated although ours was good sized and with a nice view over the Dam. Staff were not necessarily rude, but useless and incompetent at best, although I think this was simply because the staff just did not care. Got a good deal on the internet, but wish I would've paid more and gone somewhere else.####[['hotel quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
friendly, central, and clean Just spent 3 nights at the Magda Etoile and have to say we were very impressed by a number of points. The position is within 2 minutes walk of the Arch. The staff are absolutely helpful and friendly and the rooms are not as small as we thought they would be with a quaint little balcony. Interiors were very clean and the bathroom excellent. Didnt have breakfast there, so cant really comment.

i would rather sleep in my car i fly and stay at hotels a lot... this has got to be on my top 5 worst! the staff was rude, the elevator was broke, the room was disgusting and the ambiance was...well, ghetto. there were drug deals going on in daylight and ladies soliciting beside them. the place is rundown and needs a good cleaning. stay away and spend your dollar a bit further away from the airport.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative']]
Newly fitted room, expensive breakfast It鈥檚 a big hotel in the middle of the city. Quite old even if the room and bathroom are newly fitted. Nice selection beauty products and it鈥檚 possible to choose the most comfortable pillow. It鈥檚 quite an anonymous, therefore, if you鈥檙e looking to something with a traditional Dutch atmosphere it鈥檚 not the hotel for you. Breakfast is incredibly expensive and it鈥檚 better to go to one of the bakeries or cafes鈥?around.

an't wait to return to UMA Stayed at the UMA for 2 nights in a terrace room and emerged totally relaxed and recharged. Was lucky to catch the hotel in low season, place was utterly serene and prob only saw a handful of other guests around the entire time. Restaurant, poolbar and front desk staff were friendly and helpful. What I really appreciated:5mins walk from Mozaic (must be the best restaurant in Bali)Pool is a good length could be 25metresFree transfers to town from morning to nightResort is lush and green with lots of plants  flowersComo shambhala toiletriesNo major issues with the hotel except that there were flies by the poolside, which makes it inconvenient if you want to leave your food /drink unguarded while you take a dip.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative']]

Great Rooms, Good Location, Pricey Very nice 1 bedroom suite in a great location near shopping and subway. Staff very friendly. This was a business junket, so we didn't have to pick up the tab.

Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A'dam. A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station. We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean, attractive and had an great bathroom. The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little (not mid-forties with beard) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room (free tea/coffee/chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free)Only minor points but will be staying there again in September. Try the DutchFlyer website (Stena lines) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing.

Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of. Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation, the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel, which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare. We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn't get much satisfaction. I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service. We will not be going back there.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $34 dollars a day. I may have been ok with this had I known, but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website. The manager was quick to show me where the charge was buried in the website rather than to come to some agreement since this was a suprise. Be careful when staying here..... there is a charge for just about everything including to use the gym.####[['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Ideal For Long Weekend First impressions of the hotel were excellent. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff who were keen to ensure that our stay in the hotel and Barcelona was as pleasant as possible. Our room was large, if basic, with a good standard of cleanliness. Due to the tiled floors the noise from corridors did tend to echo in our room however, this was not a particular problem that would put us off returning to the hotel in the future. The location is ideal for the tourist with limited time, very close to the centre but situated away from the noise of the main thoroughfare.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great location, not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size. I reserved directly with the hostel by email (in Spanish) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going, specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square. However, we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal, overlooking the road that was being dug up. Although they said the next day we could move rooms, they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning, which was rather annoying. Overall, it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great affordable place to stay I stayed for two nights last weekend and had a perfectly enjoybale stay.

I was on my own and was out most of the time exploring NYC, but I had a very nice room to come home to. The room was quiet and the lock on the door was very sturdy.

friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner, given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures, and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were, which we found to be most helpful. The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast (buffet), it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers. A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found, also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby, making the hotel very central but not noisey. We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible.

Great hotel in the middle of nowhere Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed by the hotel, modern, fun and great rooms sizes although it does have a bit of a conference centre feel to it. Had a room on one of the top floors which offered the most spectacular views. The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit. Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Wow, what a great little hotel. My wife and I loved the hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was quiet (exactly what we asked for), the atmosphere was great and we both loved the old world charm of the histiric building. Great shopping nearby and an easy walk to most of downtown San Francisco. We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation. This is the second time my wife stayed at the Beresford and it was as a result of her first stay (10 years ago) that we decided to stay there this time, neither of us regretted that decision and we will certainly be staying there the next time we visit San Franciso.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms, so we decided to try this (based on reviews from TripAdvisor, of course).Upon arriving at the airport (Narita), we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there, right across the street from the hotel. Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo, but that's a 5 minute train ride, with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3~5.About the hotel it is huge, with many options for food and entertainment, I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses. Depending on which tower you stay in (Main Tower was great), the rooms are new, but a bit small, with everything needed in a hotel, including a small fridge (bring your snacks and water).Very clean, nothing to say about that, except that some floors smelled like cigarretts. Internet is paid (about US$10.00) and it is wired, so bring your wireless router (Apple makes a great pocket-sized one).There's a convenience store downstairs, that over charges everything, but when needed it's there.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
>Top of the town Long weekend in New York, for me and the family, this place was great. The views from the room of the East side where great, the kids loved it. The bar was great for views of central park and the stars that come in for a drink. Its a great hotel and great location.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Our worries melted away when we stepped through the door Making reservations at a hotel we had never seen gave my boyfriend and I a degree of pause. We were not sure what to expect. We could not have been more impressed with the atmosphere and service. The room was tidy and comfortable. If you go to New Orleans and you want to experince the style of the Quarter, skip the chain places and stay here. Say hi to Leonard for us.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
A Little gem Myself and my partner stayed here for a long weekend from Dublin, the staff wee very helpful and friendly hotel itself is in a lovely location and extremely quiet. Would absolutely recommend for a business or pleasure trip. The only one small drawback was no restaurant, however lots of good cafes in the area.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it. Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it's a good standard hotel it's no longer that great. Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that. Now seems full of coch parties, meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners. A real shame.####[['hotel general', 'negative']]
Not for me Didn't really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities, however we knew this before checking in. The room we had was very basic, had no safe, was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel, were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed. The hotel is well situated for Market Street and Powell Street and is fine if you're looking for an economy hotel and economy it certainly is.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Hotel Casci Hotel Casci is a small family run hotel in Florence, well located and convenient to the Duomo and other sites. The staff was a joy to deal with, no request was too small or too much trouble for them. Their restaurant suggestions were wonderful and their customer service was excellent. This was a our first stay in Florence and Hotel Casci was the perfect location. We spent five nights and highly recommend this hotel to future travelers.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great choice in the Quarter Stayed here for four nights and would choose this hotel again. If your looking for a clean room, near Bourbon Street, friendly staff, at a good price - this is the place. I also was in and out of a few other hotels were relatives were staying, if your looking for four elevators, and a large lobby, and all the stuff that comes with a large big name hotel - you aren't going to get it at the St. Marie. I'd recommend it as a great place to stay for a great price.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive']]
Stylish, friendly I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it. The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera, ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district. Breakfast was a lavish cold buffet, everything was superband included in the price. Drinks at the bar were expensive though. If I should be so lucky as to return to SF, I would want to stay again.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Not bad but could be better, even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations -- really quite nice, but the room itself was fairly spartan. It did have a little sitting area, with two chairs and a table, but the beds were rock hard (you want to ease down on them gently, lest you break a body part). The air conditioning was non-operative during our very warm stay in early-mid May (the screenless window opened, however), the TV remote control did not work, although there was an attempt to repair it, and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced -- and was, with one that smelled somewhat less musty. On the positive side, the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful, the public areas and the rooms were immaculate, the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient, if not particularly appealing. 聽聽####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Nice Stayed here for my 30th birthday weekend, booked a standard double, but got upgraded to a deluxe room, very nice indeed. probably the best hotel room i've ever stayed in anywhere in the world. very clean, very quiet, huge bed. front desk staff were very plesent. quite near to Tower hill tube, so travelling to the more lively spots is very easy.recomended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Horrendous customer service Overall, stay was just okay, but was tainted by management's unwillingness to honor their own quoted/written and confirmed total cost. At check-out, ended up paying additional 10% because of hotel's error in confirmation, even after being told at check-in that they would honor confirmed price. For this alone, would never recommend or stay there again, and we do intend to visit San Juan again. Conceptually, hotel was great architectural idea. Interior build-out, however, was done way too frugally, and there was lots of deferred maintainance in room.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Totally gorgeous From start to finish our stay at the New York Palace was perfect. Before going we emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room with a view and we most definitely got one. Our room looked out over St Patrick's Cathedral and was gorgeous. Everyone at the hotel was incredibly helpful and made our stay very pleasant. I will stay here every time I go back to New York.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Divine! This hotel, with its immaculately clean and well-fitted rooms, situated at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, is the perfect base for any holiday in this extraordinarily beautiful, safe and secure city. The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful, the service is splendid, however what really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the Breakfast Room on the 6th Floor with its stunning views of the Duomo, the Campanile and a myriad of terra-cotta rooftops. What an environment to enjoy a truly sumptuous buffet breakfast that really sets you up for the day!####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Great location and service Perfect location on the waterfront. Great views of the city. Light , tasty and affordable meals at the downstairs tavern area and cafe. Loved the in-room computer, the plush bathrobes provided, and the gratuity-inclusive service. Very nice pool and exercise area.

Immaculate, vintage hotel with personable staff--worth the price This impeccably-restored, 1880's era hotel is clean and quiet and wonderfully located in a popular historic district near the waterfront. Our train was delayed and the night desk clerk cheerfully greeted us at 3 AM and even held the door for us. The breakfast, including hard-boiled eggs, various cereals and fresh batter with waffle-maker, was delicious. It is a bit pricey but we would stay there again in a heartbeat and recommend it highly.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral']]
Decent...good location Excellent location on Las Ramblas, easy access to transportation. Ask for a recommendation of restaurants to eat at the front desk. Every selection we tried was very good. If you have time to plan in advance, write to the Spanish Embassy for walking tour guide pamphlet. We had 3 days there and followed the pamphlet - great way to see all the sights.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
great little hotel My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights art start of july and it was perfect for what we wanted - a real find. Located in quiet area but a quick 15-20 mins walk to San Marco square. Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was lovely (far surpassed expectations, Fruit, croissants, cheese, meat and lovely coffee made fresh from espresso maker) served in the little courtyard. While it has a 2 star rating, its because it doesn't have things like elevators, a big fancy lobby or iron for guests, but everything else about it was 4 star!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative']]
fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor, and yet again have not been let down. This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona, the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel, to when you leave. We had a standard room for four nights, and it was just what we needed, I understand that there are better rooms, but this was above what you normally get in this price range. There was plenty of space, the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy, Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas, but when its cold and wet, we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway. All in all a great hotel, and will be stopping again in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

A happy accident We were put into this hotel by BA when our aircraft developed a mechanical problem and the return flight to London had to be delayed until the next day. In every way the Sheraton Gateway was better than the Holiday Inn at LAX where we spent the first night of our recent holiday. The lobby staff were efficient, the food and service in the restaurant were good and our room was great. We will definitely consider returning to this hotel when we stay at LAX again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Good Value - Bring Your Reservation - Great value.- Big clean room with full kitchen.- Great Location.- Quiet- Security patrols the grounds.- Ate at Cuban place around the corner. Great food at a great price.- Front desk tried to over charge. Good thing we had our reservation printout.- Outside of the building is covered with mold but the inside is clean and odor free.- Wireless internet service is in the lobby and food area only.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Excellent Location I stayed at this hotel for pleasure using Marriott Reward points for 2 nights. The hotel is ideally situated in the Circular Quay area, only 3 minutes from the City Train stop from the airport. Circular Quay is also where the Opera House and the Ferries are located allowing easy access to all of Syndney, including the Rocks area, Harbor Bridge, shopping, Rocks market, and ferries to Manly and everywhere else. The hotel was also within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants in the Rocks area. The room provided was better than average for Marriott, with all amenities and nice shower.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Location, Location, Location -- and a great hotel Just returned from staying three nights at the Chancellor Hotel and have to say that all the Trip Advisor reviews were right on the money. We enjoyed the above-par service, the clean and cozy room (yes, a little tight but workable), the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24/7, and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere -- all at a very reasonable price. Best of all, the hotel is totally non smoking!! Location is perfect, right near Union Square and in front of a cable car stop, within walking distance of many fine resturaunts and shopping areas. Kudos to the Chancellor for making our stay in San Francisco most enjoyable!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Go for the Casitas! The El conquistador Casitas were awesome. The one I stayed in was huge with a full kitchen and ocean view from the balcony. It was clean, airy and felt like a vacation home not a hotel room. The Casitas are a bit more pricey than the hotel rooms at the resort but definately worth every penny.

The Perfect Stay in Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hotel about a month ago and thought is was the ideal place to stay in Barcelona. We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris, so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury. The location on the Ramblas was ideal (right near the metro stop from the train station too) and the room was just wonderful. We highly reccomended this hotel to anyone.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Fabulous, and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel. Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city. Having spent a few hours doing the usual sightseeing, we ended up feeling that we should spend more time in the hotel enjoying its facilities (including a lovely swimming pool) and less time pounding the humid streets. It is very expensive but for a short stay, thoroughly worthwhile.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

great location Location is great, near corner of Orchard and Scotts. Club lounge is nice, although no hot offering at breakfast, which although ok for my wife, expect a hot offering at Grand Hyatt Grand Clubs (best is in HK). Stayed in a junior suite with wife and two kids (combo business and holiday). Great room, plenty of space, although bed is very firm (westin heavenly beds are clearly superior).

Left after 1 night I lasted one night - the room was tiny, barely lit, musty and just unbearable.

Fantastic Value After reading reviews on the Moore, my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location. We were not disappointed. Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value. Our only knock would be that there was no A/C, which could be a problem on a very hot day as the room gets full afternoon sun.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
great location but thats about it. My husband and I have jusy returned from a four night stay in the Byrant hotel ,we chose it after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor. The location is fantastic and the rooms are well laid out very well serviced etc. I would not reccomend this hotel because of the snooty attitute of quite a few of the staff which made it very uncomfortable, it was not a hotel to relax in just one to be seen in if you were of a certain age and dressed in a certain manner.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Don't believe anything you read or half of what your hear We recently came back from this resort. It is advertised on the Sol Melia website as being fully renovated, which it hasn't been touched in eight years and is in need of a complete overhaul. The food is mediocure at best, 11 restaurants, only three or four open each night, beach chairs moldy and streached out, dirty beach, mildewed rooms, worn fabrics and furniture in rooms, mini bar not stocked or cold, disagreeable staff, bad service and bugs in the rooms. AA Vacations website states this is a five star property. We would rate it -5 stars. Royal Service is a joke, don't dare pay extra for it, you will be sorry, extra money for nothing, and don't drink the water.####[['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Lots of character! This is a beautiful hotel - tonnes of character - also in a fantastic spot - right on union square with a cable care outside.

It'll be great when it's finished! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel. We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed, the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom. Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room. The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there.

Decent hotel at Fisherman's Wharf This is the second time we've stayed at the Wharf Inn. It's reasonably priced, very close to Fisherman's Wharf, has free parking for one car, and the rooms are OK. Stay away from the mini-suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason  Bay; it's one of the noisiest hotel rooms I've ever had the pleasure of being moved from. Great view, though. If you want quiet, you have to put up with the view of the adjacent building.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
mfortable base for touring New York We stayed at the Eastgate Tower hotel during the October downpours in New York. We found the hotel very comfortable, with a huge suite including a living area, large bed, decent bathroom and usable kitchen. Compared to similar priced hotels in New York, it earns its above average rating. The location is good for the mid-town attractions, and also has good bus and subway links to SoHo, Greenwich Village, etc. Despite the torrential rain, we enjoyed our stay and still managed to have a fantastic time!!####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive']]
decent hotel As others have said, this place is nothing special, but for the price and location, it's actually very special. The actual room is a perfectly adequate budget motel room, except that our room had a view of coit tower, transamerica building, and the rest of downtown sf. From what I could see, other more expensive hotels near the area probably can't claim to have the view that we did. And that also means that you can walk to all kinds of great places and take the bus to others. Now if the kind people at the Columbus could only bring some sunshine and warmth to the city, then you would really have something.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
