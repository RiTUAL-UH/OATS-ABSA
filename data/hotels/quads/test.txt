Helpful staff and warm atmosphere####[]
My daughter and I stayed just one night at The Chesterfield and took advantage of the promotion found on the hotel's website that included a full breakfast.####[]
The hotel was warm, clean, safe and very British.####[]
Breakfast was a huge cold buffet as well as hot offerings from the kitchen; a real treat.####[]
Though not the least expensive room in the city, for about $200, it was, for two of us, worth every penny.####[]
Plus we got to leave our bags there the next day while we were out exploring.####[]
Loved####[]
It Had a great time there####[]
The food was pretty good for an all inclusive resort and the service was excellent.####[]
Had a beautiful beach and many activities to keep the fun going.####[]
The only thing I didn't like was the that the beds were horrible, but everything else made up for i####[]
Lovely lobby, good ambience####[]
The Doubletree at the Campbell Centre in Dallas has charm and character; values so often lacking in large hotels aimed at business travellers.####[]
The hotel boasts a framed collection of native American arrow heads and the lobby is decorated in a vibrant and tasteful way.####[]
There's a comedy club next door.####[]
I had a corner room with good views and high speed internet, while breakfast was hearty with a good range of choices.####[]
The staff seemed attentive and friendly and there was plenty of parking out front.####[]
Fine, nothing more####[]
We arrived really tired from a very delayed flight, and the room was fine.####[]
For the price, I would prefer washable duvet covers instead of the yucky bedspreads.####[]
Anyways, we liked the free wireless internet, and the hotel suited us just fine--####[]
we slept well and had no troubles.####[]
They were happy to hold our reservation until 3am because of the delayed flight, and to keep a non-smoking king for us, which we appreciated.####[]
Listen to Trip Advisor!!!!####[]
We did a lot of research before going and wanted someplace that was in a good central location, and was not too expensive.####[]
Following the good reviews on TA, we made reservations at the Nob Hill Motor Inn.####[]
Everything said about this place is true.####[]
But the one thing that is not mentioned enough is the owners Frank and Judy.####[]
They not only run a great hotel, but they will help however they can to make your vacation great.####[]

Centrally located, friendly staff, and quiet rooms.####[]
If you want to eat, you can walk next door to the Hilton and use them for their restaurants, then walk across the street for ice cream.####[]

Hotel Carton review Booked a room at this hotel for a great price after reading some good reviews on TA.####[]
Staff were very pleasant, rooms were clean and modern, location was great, although one wrong turn####[]
and you could end up near the tenderloin, although to their credit, the staff at the hotel tell you this immediately.####[]
When you check in, they give you a map, and tell you exactly where not to go, so you really have no excuses.####[]
However, as said before, the location is great and you're close (walking distance) to some great places.####[]
Recommended!####[]
Perfect 5-star hotel, but no 5-star palace Just passed three nights there.####[]
The 5 stars are justified by the quality of the bed, the size of the room, the choice of restaurants, the excellent noise protection, the impressive size of the lobby and the bar.####[]
The spa on the top floor is great: very clean, extremely friendly staff (like in the rest of the hotel).####[]
Noteworthy: it is the only really centrally located 5-star hotel in Frankfurt.####[]
Breakfast is OK, nothing very special for the high price it is.####[]
fantastic, great location, helpful staff####[]
If you are going to NY and want to stay centrally..####[]
this is the perfect choice.####[]
Really nice location in central Manhatten, very helpful service and staff all incredibly nice.####[]
Try and stay in a room as high as possible for the better views.####[]
Easy to walk around Manhatten for Shopping, Broadway and SightseeingNot the cheapest, but one has to be one of the nices####[]
Easter in NOLA####[]
We spent Easter weekend in New Orleans and stayed at The Prince Conti again.####[]
We were in NOLA over Halloween and found this gem, so it will be the only place we will stay from now on!####[]
The staff is always engaging and helpful, the rooms are spotless and roomy and the location can't be beat.####[]
The easter baskets Ann placed in our room were a great touch and we look forward to returning again soon!####[]
We feel like we are family there and higly recommend it to anyone and everyone we can!####[]
mfortable place to stay, wonderful concierge!####[]
This is a very good hotel, located about 10 min walk from Chapultepec Park and only 5 min away from the metro.####[]
The rooms were very clean and comfortable.####[]
The small pool and exercise room were nice as well.####[]
The greatest thing about the hotel was the impeccable concierge service who was always ready to recommend activities (whether the commercial day trips or our DIY activities).####[]
Perfect stay was a bit concerned after reading mixed reviews but would highly reccomend this hotel, we were upgraded to sea front view and as it was my 30th birthday they had a complimentary cake waiting for me in my room!!####[]
the hotel staff could not do enough, very accomodating.####[]
The breakfast was amazing and it was lovely sitting out in the early morning sun to eat it.####[]
Rooms very spacious, comfy beds and the bathroom was out of this world, only problem we did have was we did have to ask for the room to be made up after returning as it had not been done, but this was then done immediately.####[]
perfect Me and my wife came from Iceland to Barcelona to celebrate her birthday and chose the Pulitzer.####[]
From now on this is our hotel in Barcelona.####[]
I booked a romantic/celebration stay and it was perfect, from a bottle of Cava waiting in our room which was spacious and welcoming to booking a perfect meal at Quatre Gats restaurant.####[]
When we came back from the meal a hot bath was waiting for my wife with cava, strawberries and chocolate and the room decorated with roses, perfect.####[]
Front desk and all staff was perfect, they organised a masseuse to come to our room for a deep and relaxing massage for my wife.####[]
We will certainly stay there again.####[]
The Reviews Are Right####[]
The reviews on this site are correct - great location near the train station, convenient to all sights, clean, great breakfast, and nice rooms.####[]
Staff is very helpful and friendly.####[]
On a side note, for dinner, try Il Latini...####[]

Exceptional Service at Green Isle Inn####[]
It is with great pleasure that I, Moses Oquendo highly recommend Green Isle Hotel to anybody planning to stay at an affordable hotel close to San Juan, Puerto Rico.####[]
The customer service representatives at Green Isle are exceptional; the rooms are well organized and cleaned.####[]
I am very honor to have to privilege to stay at Green Isle with my family members April 15 through April 22, 2005.####[]
I must give Special Thank You to Juan for all his support in order to grant us room # 123.####[]
My room was Robbed at Riu Palace Punta Cana####[]
On June 7, 2006 two personal items were stolen from my hotel room between 11:45 AM and 6:30 PM, a cell phone and a digital camara.####[]
The individual who stole my personal items had a key and access to my room.####[]
When visiting the Riu Palace resort, make sure to lock all valuables in the safe and secure the key.####[]
Budget hotel with a very good location Located in the heart of Chinatown, this is a great budget hotel for those who want to have just a place to sleep.####[]
The rooms are pretty small, but the bathroon was pretty big comparing to the room.####[]
It was mostly clean, except the bedclothes/towels, which could be better.####[]
We had a double room with a street view, and it was much lighter, than our friends room, which has only one window with a courtyard view, but it was much more noisy...####[]
The front desk is a bit smelly and old, but the staff was nice.####[]
Lovely hotel I was lucky enough to get one of their 拢1 rooms but would have been just as happy paying the standard rate.####[]
Lovely modern hotel with friendly helpful staff.####[]
Rooms were lovely with everything you needed.####[]
The pillows and duvets were divine.####[]
The bathroom was lovely with a large walk in shower.####[]
Would definately recommend it.####[]
great experience I stayed just after MArdi Gras.####[]
The rooms are so comfortable and unique.####[]
Not your cookie cutter hotel in a box!####[]
I went to the big Easy for the whole experience and this hotel was perfect.####[]
The staff was very nice and it is in a great location.####[]
I will definitly be back!####[]
Great value####[]
My wife and I stayed at the Royal Garden during our Christmas holiday.####[]
We found the hotel staff incredily helpful and friendly.####[]
The room was clean and comfortable and had a great view.####[]
The hotel's location was convenient - two blocks within the major shopping area - and a short walk to the beach.####[]
Overall, comparing the hotel rate with the experience provided, we felt that the Royal Garden was a great value.####[]
Worse Place on Earth!!!!####[]
This was the most disgusting hotel we've ever stayed at!####[]
It was way over priced and filthy!####[]
We stayed here out of convienince since we had an over night layover for our international flight - we didn't want to have to ride a shuttle bus####[]
so thought this was a good option - biggest mistake of all time!####[]
Great Location Shabby Room####[]
Although the Ambassador was well located,had a pleasant and helpful staff, and good food service, I will probably not stay there again.####[]
My single room was shabby with wallpaper peeling off the wall, a clean but threadbare carpet,and dated furniture.####[]
As a single traveller, I was only allowed one pillow on the double bed and one towel in the bath.####[]
The ventilation in the lobby was poor so the cigarette smoke was toxic.####[]
Excellent stay in paris####[]
We had a very good stay at hotel du cadran.####[]
Very clean and well decorated rooms.####[]
we have been sevral times in paris, and this time was the best.####[]
The hotel is in a very quiet area, near eiffel tower.####[]
Great Hotel, superb location Just returned from H10 Montcada, this is an excellent hotel in a great location in Barri Gothic one street away from La Ramblas.####[]
Yes the rooms are quite small but we had no problems and it does have a great bathroom.####[]
Only minor problem was with the room safe not opening one evening, this was rectified within 5 mnutes of informing reception.####[]
Got the aerobus from airport for 3.90 euro single, stops right outside the arrivals at airport, hotel is a 10 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya use via Laetana to walk down, its less crowded to walk with a trolley case.####[]
Used the Bus turistic two-day pass for sightseeing, this is an excellent way to see all the best bits of Barcelona.####[]
Highly recommended hotel, and a great city to visit.####[]
Really great!####[]
I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel for the comparatively little money we spent.####[]
The lobby was very pretty and new, the rooms were spacious, the bathroom newly renovated (small) but very clean.####[]
And it is but a block from Times Square, so the location is terrific.####[]
The staff was friendly and helpful.####[]
I would absolutely stay there again.####[]
great location Stayed here for a convention at a reduced rate.####[]
Room had a high quality 42 inch HD TV and was very comfortable.####[]
Excellent location close to Moscone convention center, restaurants, cable car, and shopping.####[]
I really enjoyed Yerba Buena Garden right next to it and the bar with a terrific view on the 39th floor.####[]
My only complaint is that there are three sets of elevators going to different floors which was confusing for the first day or two.####[]
Guests have to transfer elevators to get from certain floors to other floors.####[]
Great Value and Big Rooms####[]
We chose the Affinia 50 for a visit with our 2 kids (ages 9 and 15) and were very pleased with the room, location and service.####[]
We often stay in NYC for business, and have stayed in many hotels and we were very impressed with the size of the room, the nice decor and the overall comfort.####[]
The front door staff is very friendly and efficient.####[]
I would highly reccomend this hotel for the value.####[]
super stay, super staff, super location We stayed for a relaxing weekend in Berlin and booked a room in the Westin Grand.####[]
What a hotel!!!!####[]
A nice and charming lobby, very helpful and polite staff whereever you go.####[]
The room was a more than well appointed junior suite with very large bathroom, perfect cleaned and everything in very good condition.####[]
Perfect service were ever expect it, from turndown to morning newspaper to valet parking.####[]
Excellent value for money and we will come back.####[]
Nothing to write home about Was happy to get back to the land of the modern living after being in Fiji but was disappointed by the hotel in general.####[]
Check in took ages, hotel decor was dull and drab, our room stank of cigarettes.####[]
Breakfast was average.####[]
We would stay here again if we were stuck####[]
but it definitely wouldnt set your world on alight.####[]
Loved our stay!!!!####[]
Stayed at the Hotel Elysee for three nights and it was wonderful.####[]
The room was large for New York, very clean  quiet, (a plus in midtown NY!)####[]
Staff was very helpful  the continental breakfast####[]
evening wine  snacks was an added plus!!####[]
Pleasant and affordable####[]
We stayed in this hotel for three nights in December.####[]
It was pleasant and affordable, with decent parking.####[]
The best feature is that it is right across the street from the Bayside Marina Mall.####[]
This gave us an easy place to go for food, hanging out, etc...####[]
Great Quality 3 star, more like 4 star for Paris####[]
My stay here was owing to a corporate referral.####[]
An excellent location with great staff, service and moderately sized but modernised rooms.####[]
If you are aware of Parisien hotel standards you will appreciate the quality, value for money and convenience of this hotel.####[]
Lorraine, Dublin, Ireland####[]
Great bed - bad pool area####[]
This is a great place to stay for a night before or after a flight into SFO especially as there are great rates to be gotten online and/or via Priceline.####[]
The bed is absolutely perfect with nice crisp sheets!The foyer area and bar are beautiful.####[]
Went to the pool area and it looked a little run down.####[]
The pool is very small and the whirlpool looked like an oversized bathtub that someone would have in their home in the 1970's.####[]
We didn't stay to use anything.####[]
a terrible experience####[]
The worst nightmare I 've ever lived.####[]
My wife got a severe food poison for which we've spent 3 nights in a hospital in punta cana.####[]
You'll probably say was just our bad luck####[]
but then why the hospital was full with ppl with the same problem and most of them from the same resort(melia caribe tropical)?Service is bad too and very few exceptions didn't change the overall impression.####[]
At the end a group of ppl from th hospital we've decided to send a formal letter through a lawyer to general manager of the Melia Caribe /Tropical.####[]
Lovely, peaceful hotel 2nd visit to Paris.####[]
First time we stayed at The Novotel which was too large  very businesslike.####[]
We really enjoyed the position of Hotel Bassano in a typical, quiet part of Paris - a much more romantic setting.####[]
The staff are very polite  willing to please.####[]
We found the room delightful  very comfortable (it was much appreciated when we went out for the evening to find our bed had been turned back  chocolates left for us - a very nice touch).####[]
Definitely recommend.####[]
Best views of Seattle and free parking!####[]
This is one of the best hotel experiences I have had while staying in Seattle!####[]
We booked a room on a higher floor and hd views of the city that where fantastic.####[]
The staff were very helpful and being so close to major road ways helped to get all around the area.####[]
Great location, nice people We just got back from a 4-night stay in Room 4 on the top floor, and encountered a grand total of one mosquito in our room.####[]
No problems with that at all.####[]
The rooms could use some spiffing up, but ours was quite comfortable and certainly not ugly or tacky in any way.####[]
The location can't be beat, and the people running it were as nice and helpful as could be.####[]
Not a luxury property, but a good value.####[]
Either You Love it or You####[]
Hate it.####[]
No in-between.####[]
Hotel Exterior####[]
Great for special break####[]
We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon####[]
and I cannot praise it highly enough, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm.####[]
The rooms are spacious and luxurious and the staff are very attentive, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.####[]
Just the Job####[]
My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in August and couldn't fault it for what we wanted.####[]
Great location, the concierge guy was fantastic and there is a lovely restaurant attached to the hotel that does a great breakfast!No bar as such in the hotel####[]
but they have free wine tasting every day at 5p.m.!####[]
Great location across Arno River Hotel Silla is a great find across the river from all the main sights in Florence.####[]
Their customer service is top notch, they are always willing to answer questions, recommend a restaurant or reserve an entrance to a museum or tourist attraction.####[]
They provide free internet access in the lobby, and their breakfast is terrific!####[]
Also, enjoy a bottle or glass of wine outside on the terrace in the evening.####[]
It's generally quiet, but be aware that on a weekend evening, it can get loud as there are a few restaurants  bars on the block where locals party.####[]
We had a great stay, and would return to Hotel Silla again.####[]
Noisy...####[]
I must admit the Hotel Fusion is a great bargain in a great location.####[]
My room was large but basic.####[]
My only compaint is that while they went to great lengths to renovate the hotel they overlooked one detail, insulated windows.####[]
I was on the 4th floor and the street noise penetrating into my room overnight was almost unbearable.####[]
I am not a light sleeper and if you are I would recommend staying somewhere else.####[]
>If you are traveling on a budget, this is great ...####[]
If you are doing San Juan on a shoestring, the Mango Inn will not disappoint.####[]
Sure, the view from your room may be obstructed by a billboard and the faucet might drip all night, but for $75 you can't beat it.####[]
If you are reasonably low maintenance this is definitely worth it.####[]
- Submitted by a girly girl.####[]
Great value for money!####[]
In crazy expensive London, it's hard to find decent, affordable accomodation.####[]
Our simple twin room here was small but comfortable - the staff accomodated our request for a quiet back room and it was nice.####[]
The breakfast was average.####[]
The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of Victoria station, which makes the price even more remarkable!####[]
Awesome hotel####[]
This is one of the best hotels I have ever liven in.####[]
We went there for our Puerto Rico leg of the honeymoon and the service the staff and the rooms were excellent.####[]
The private beach is awesome with the bar right next to it.####[]
I strongly recommend the steak at the restaurant along with their excellent collection of red wines.####[]
Excellent value I stayed at the Affinia Dumont on my third business trip to New York, and this is the best hotel value for the money in NYC or anywhere else.####[]
It's perfect for those wanting to mix business and pleasure thanks to an enormous desk and Aeron chair as well as a lovely looking spa####[]
(I just used the yoga room one morning).####[]
Also a well-equiped fitness room, which I didn't need because I walked 6 to 10 miles a day!####[]
The elements that made this a standout for me were the excellent lighting (including some energy-efficient fixtures)--especially the reading lights over the bed, over the desk, and by the reading chair--and the great mirrors everywhere you could possibly want them.####[]
Overall, including its fully equipped galley kitchen, it's larger than some NYC studio apartments!####[]
great for golf Overall a great experience.####[]
We went strictly for golf.####[]
There are two courses, both well maintained and challenging.####[]
The club pro Robert is a great guy and an excellent teacher.####[]
The resort offers a golf package which is works out as well or better than a lot of places in fla and so carolina.####[]
i liked the place To my surprise####[]
this was actually a very well run and a very nice resort.####[]
I arrived expecting the worst and they were actuallly better than what is being told on the page first the employees were very helpful and courteous####[]
the room was very nice , you are in the tropics so you keep the air conditioning on to circulate the air, We enjoyed the food and entertainment.####[]
The beaches and the pool were excelant.####[]
I am truly trying to get back to this resort again.........####[]
Loved It####[]
We stayed here for 2 Nights in 2004 and loved the hotel.####[]
The location is great as its on the busy Orchard Rd shopping area with easy access to the MRT and transport links.####[]
The buffet breakfast was awesome and the rooms were great too.####[]
We would stay there again.####[]
Great Location Stayed at the Hilton Times Square sept 2-3 2005 with my husband and two teenaged sons.####[]
The hotel is well located and we would definitely stay there again.####[]
We were on the 25th floor facing 41st and found the room to be quiet.####[]
Many restaurants, cinemas, shopping steps away.####[]
My base in Hong Kong There are plenty of good comments about this hotel already posted here on Trip Advisor.####[]
This is a well run, clean and nicely appointed hotel that is very handy for the airport as well as being only a few stops on the MRT to Central Hong Kong.####[]
The hotel is attached to a newly built shopping centre.####[]
If you can live without the hussle and bussle of a city centre then this hotel is a good option.####[]
I am in Asia 6 or 7 times a year and use this property as my base from which I then travel in and out from the nearby airpor####[]
I just loved this hotel!!!!!!####[]
We stayed at this hotel while on vacation in L.A. last summer.####[]
I was extremely pleased with everything about this hotel, there is not one thing that I could complain about.####[]
Ideal location, extra clean, friendly staff, wonderful breakfast buffet, beautiful rooms, etc.####[]
This is one place that I would return to over  over again.####[]
Pampered at the Peninsula Spent four nights at the Peninsula Palace in September.####[]
The Bedroom on one of the executive club floors was terrific - huge bed, internet conections, air con that obeyed us, flat screen TV and even a second TV in the bathroom!####[]
The Executive Club rooms could not be faulted with speedy check-in and check-out , great breakfasts and a splendid happy hour.####[]
The hotel is in an ideal situation near to Beijing's main sights and a shopping area.####[]
Restaurants were fi####[]
Loved the Location I was warned that it was away from the city centre.####[]
My check in was handled reasonably smooth and the room was a decent size.####[]
The staff were very courteous.####[]
There is a market place on the other side but this does not cause any disturbance.####[]
The tram stop is just across the road and most of the sites are accessible quickly.####[]
A tram card is an important asset in Amsterdam.####[]
Great Location, Great Hotel You won't find a better location in Amsterdam.####[]
This is right opposite the Central Train Station and within walking distance of every tourist spots.####[]
The hotel is clean and tidy and lovely amenities.####[]
My parents also stayed here when they visited too and loved it.####[]
I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone going to Amsterdam.####[]
Great Service and accomadtions####[]
At the time of our arrival we were greeted by a very friendly doorman.####[]
After a very pleasent check in we were taken to our room by the bellman.####[]
He infromed us of all the services avavilable at the hotel.####[]
We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel's restaurant followed by after dinner drinks in the lounge.####[]
Next time we come to San Francisco we will stay at the Omni again.####[]
Great location####[]
A great location within walking distance of interesting sites.####[]
Not too far from an American Express office which came in handy.####[]
Did not try the full breakfast in the morning -- the muffins and fruit on the continental table were enough.####[]
Great advice on restaurants, appreciated the loan of an umbrella, and help with directions.####[]
Good Hotel Just returned from Hong Kong, where I resided five days at the Langham Place, inspired by the reviews on this site.####[]
I decided to stay at this hotel not only because of the overall favorably opinions but mainly because of the rapport between quality and price, which turned out to be excellent.####[]
For a good hotel with great amenities and services, it was reasonable.####[]
I am not a fan of huge hotels of this type, but I found that the service was maintained on all levels.####[]
I loved the spa and the outdoor pool which was big enough with an amazing view.####[]
Perfect Paris Holiday Great hotel in an excellent location.####[]
Room was very clean, staff was friendly, very helpful and speak English for those not fluent in French.####[]
5 minute walk to the RER station and Champs Elysees and the Arch of Triumph.####[]
Very easy to navigate to/from CDG airport and the sites from this location.####[]
Will definetly book this hotel again when I return for my next visit to Paris.####[]
Overall good, but too expensive####[]
Overall####[]
it was a good hotel, but I think too expensive.####[]
Good:- great breakfast for the money (it was only 6.50 euro for booking online)- big room and the expected comfort for a 3 star hotelBad:- quite far from city center and metro station-####[]
too noisy (situated on a big street)####[]
Great place Before going####[]
I had read all the reviews posted on the site####[]
and I am glad everything they say is true.####[]
It is definitely worth staying at the Chancellor.####[]
Everyone is really helpful and nice.####[]
I tried several SF hotels and this is the only one I'll go back to.####[]
xcellent stay Book this hotel back in August for a November stay,someone at the marriott hotel website made a mistake and had the web price for a two bedroom lakeview suite at $29.00 instead of $229.####[]
I jumped on it and booked it and thought I might get a hassle over it####[]
but instead the front desk staff were impressed at the rate I had recieved and happily checked me in.####[]
The staff were very friendly and the shuttle driver was excellent taking us to the downtown area whenever we needed him,of course a tip seemed to help with that.####[]
The hotel itself was clean and comfortable with a extended buffet breakfast.####[]
I would stay here again when in the area.####[]
good hotel and location for price####[]
The hotel is located near central station so location is good for accessing transit and located near major attractions Didn't use the restaurant as there are millions of restaurants in this town.####[]
Staff was pleasant and helpful.####[]
Seemed very clean other than the elevators appeared grungy and smelled funny.####[]
Nice hotel - great location.####[]
Nice hotel in a great location; S-bahn stop only a block away####[]
and you had access to the whole city.####[]
Loved staying in the area of old East Berlin - there is history everywhere.####[]
Stylish decor, staff very nice.####[]
Great breakfast!####[]
Best Deal in Hong Kong####[]
For the US$89 I paid, I can't imagine a better deal in Hong Kong.####[]
The room was on the small side, but it was still fine for a couple.####[]
The decor was tasteful and everything was very clean.####[]
Very convenient location as well.####[]
On the strange side, the staff uniforms looked liked an 80' wedding band.####[]
just the ticket I stayed here in 2004 for two separate stints of three nights each.####[]
Both times I was really appreciative to have a clean, safe, cool and relaxing place to stay.####[]
Overall I found the hotel simple but perfect for my needs.####[]
The pool is an added bonus for taking a moonlight dip under the lights of the surrounding skyscrapers - surreal!####[]
Don't stay here if you're fussy about cracked tiles and things like that because i'm not......####[]
Fabulous location The Hotel had been recommended by my sister and for a girl travelling on her own , it was fantastic.####[]
Located in the heart of the Latin Quarter's restaurant district , it was perfect to eat out and walk safely to hotel , even at night .Needed to close window at night tho' cos can be noisy if you are an early to bed person.####[]
Breakfast was fabulous and lovely helpful staff.####[]
I felt very secure and like I was in a home away from home .Highly####[]
recommend it , especially if a female travelling alone , very secure yet allowed freedom to eat out at night in many places around it .R.R.Australia####[]
Wonderful stay!!####[]
We stayed for 7 nights in the condos.####[]
Staff was very nice.####[]
Our rooms had great view of Waikiki Beach.####[]
We had our 10 month old with us and the extra large rooms enabled her to practice her walking without bumping into everything.####[]
Would definitely stay there again.####[]
xcellent I was in Barcelona in July.####[]
I am a travel agent and I usually stay at the Arts.####[]
Th Diplomatic has excellent service.####[]
I reserved it through Ac hotel web site for 125e.####[]
The mini bar is free.####[]
The location can not be better, walking distance to the tour bus and all the best shopping area in Barcelona####[]
Perfect location,trendy hotel####[]
We stayed her with friends [i booked the hotel] at the end of Feb.####[]
Location is perfect-so easy to walk to places.####[]
The rooms are immaculate if a little unusual with the decor and the layout of the shower and toilet but not a problem.####[]
Our room looked out to a brick wall and was a little on the dark side but our friends room had a massive window and looked out on the street which meant it was nice and light [ask for a room with a big window]A good breakfast- loads to choose from served in the tapas barWould####[]
def stay there agai####[]
Good place good rate for latin americans####[]
Well located..####[]
just in the heart of downtown Miami.####[]
Good and confortable rooms.####[]
Nice personnel.####[]
Special rate for latin american people.####[]
Great value, friendly staff####[]
This was the first stop of our honeymoon, and we very much enjoyed our stay at Amstelzicht.####[]
The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and we found the room to be satisfactory and clean.####[]
This is by no means a luxury hotel, but if you are looking for clean accomodations that present good value in Amsterdam, I highly recommend this hotel.####[]
The stairs are difficult to negotiate, so I would not recommend the hotel to those with physical disabilities.####[]
Otherwise though, we had a fabulous time, and there is a great restaurant just around the corner from the hotel.####[]
Dadeland Mall is near####[]
Well.####[]
the rooms where ok, but you could hear your next door neighbor visit the bathroom.####[]
The Staff was ok.####[]
Not too friendly but just ok.the GOOD things about this place is, that DADELAND MALL is near.####[]
A nice MALL for great shopping!####[]
Great!####[]
My friends and I stayed at this place during San Francisco Pride.####[]
It was close to where we needed to go.####[]
The rooms were nice and cheap.####[]
The staff was friendly and helful.####[]
Excellent Location####[]
The hotel is very conveniently placed and is only a two minute walk from the Duomo.####[]
The majority of the reception staff spoke good English and were always polite and friendly.####[]
The rooms are small but clean, the views are far from spectacular and the furnishings are basic.####[]
However, if you plan to spend most of your time out and about in Florence rather than in your hotel room, the Hotel Gioia proves excellent value for money.####[]
Great location but hot and noisy Great location near Catalunya Square and smarter Eixample area.####[]
Hotel spotless and staff most helpful.####[]
Very hot rooms, could not control temperature properly and noisy laminate flooring.####[]
Could hear music and noise from other rooms until early hours.####[]
Very hard beds !####[]
Avoid expensive breakfast, many local cafes do fresh croissant and coffee for 1.60####[]
highly recommend I've stayed at this hotel four or five times now.####[]
The service is excellent, and the accomodations are quite lovely.####[]
Can't beat the convenient location, as it is very near the subway with lots of taxis and busses.####[]
A light breakfast is included in your stay in the lobby, or for an extra $5 you can have it delivered to your room.####[]
The staff is very friendly.####[]
This review was written by a demanding sophisticated traveler, and ex New Yorker.####[]
lose to museums We stayed 3 nights in a large corner room overlooking the canal.####[]
Very good location for visiting the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum and easy walk to shopping area and restaurants.####[]
We found the hotel very clean and the staff very cordial.####[]
The breakfast buffet was very good.####[]
We would stay here again.####[]
Nice, if a little old####[]
We stayed here in October for a weekend getaway.####[]
The rooms are nicely appointed, if a bit old, but our ocean view from the lanai was gorgeous.####[]
The lobby has a weird fishy smell that's hard to get used to, but the employees are all very nice.####[]
Great location, too.####[]
Its got it all Excellent room and excellent location.####[]
It was the perfect place to see Florence and close enough to the train station to check out other cities close by like Pisa.####[]
Room was always clean and the staff always happy enough to help when asked.####[]
Couldnt have asked for a better place in Florence and will definately go back !####[]
wonderful hotel####[]
We loved our stay at the chesterfield in late July 2005.####[]
Thoughtful concierge helped plan a theater trip , including dinner.####[]
rooms were decent sized and nicely equipped.####[]
Lovely breakfast with nice staff (included in our rate).####[]
good location a few blocks from tube and buses.the street itslef was quiet, but there were restaurants nearby in Shepherd market (many of them open sunday night, which we did not find in other nearby neighborhoods).We would stay there again in a moment.####[]
mfortable Room, Chic space I stayed here recently on a work trip.####[]
The hotel was pretty cool as it had a variety of art pieces throughout the location and in each of the rooms.####[]
This hotel is in the warehouse district and within walking distance to some great restaurants a coffee shop and galleries galore.####[]
Also, not too far off from the Quarter.####[]
The workout room on the top floor was nice and well apportioned and the pool (also on the top floor) had nice views of the city/river.####[]
Comfortable - but a little pricey compared to what you can get in other parts of the CBD/downtown.####[]
Highly recommend the Watertown An excellent experience all around.####[]
Not at all the same old, boring hotel decor.####[]
I actually enjoyed being in my room!####[]
The staff members went out of their way to be helpful, and the breakfast was a treat.####[]
I highly recommend the Watertown.####[]
Wonderful Staff, Great Place On a sold-out summer weekend day (Saturday July 28, 2007), we found ourselves in big trouble because of a misunderstanding of the room type at the time of online reservation.####[]
The hotel staff went out of their way to resolve the situation to our satisfaction.####[]
The stay in this place was great.####[]
This Hotel is located within a block of Seattle center/Space Needle, and is within a 2 mintue monorail ride or a short drive from downtown/ Pike Market area.####[]
The room and particularly the beds are very comfortable, and the breakfast is quite good.####[]
This is a friendly place with good location and plenty of free parking space.####[]
Friendly, Clean  Excellent small boutique hotel three minutes walk from Eiffel Tour.####[]
Wonderful breakfast, decent prices on minibar items.####[]
Extremely clean and safe enviroment, updated rooms.####[]
Lots of shops and markets within 2 block radius.####[]
Stayed here with 2 six year olds this week, the staff couldn't have been more friendly to the boys.####[]
The price is amazing for the quality of this hotel.####[]
Ultra modern Very good experience.####[]
Very modern lounge and bar.####[]
Busy but quiet location.####[]
A good 4 star hotel but####[]
not really worth prices more than 130 Euros per night.####[]
Good Value/Location As far as hotels in Amsterdam go, it is a great value.####[]
The hotel is clean, provides comfortable accommodations, and is in a great location to get to museums.####[]
They provide breakfast and the desk was helpful in guiding us when needed.####[]
Their business services were also accommodating.####[]
I really have nothing bad to say -####[]
it was clean, cheap, and a great location.####[]
Well situated, great staff Small rooms, tho tastefully appointed.####[]
Great library/lounge.####[]
Excellent staff - most helpful I can recall in Paris.####[]
Great neighborhood.####[]
Great choice outside tourist district####[]
The Hotel Derby is an excellent choice and I highly recommend it.####[]
So often the staff in 4-star hotels are too stuffy yet here####[]
the people couldn't have been more helpful.####[]
If you want to be in the heart of the tourist district of Barcelona then this isn't for you, but if you prefer to do your sightseeing then escape to a peaceful haven away from it####[]
all then this is a fine choice.####[]
great hotel####[]
we really enjoyed this hotel.####[]
it is quite charming and friendly - great, very helpful staff.####[]
Good location, walking distance to union square.####[]
For the price we paid, however, the rooms were VERY small and cramped, even for a two night stay..####[]
Good choice for central location Clean with nice decor and reasonably large rooms.####[]
Excellent location####[]
about 10- minutes walk from Barri Gothic and 15minutes from the SAngria Familia.####[]
The hotel is great as a base base to visit the sites or even if you are there on business ( free internet connection) .####[]
However there are few facilities outside the room and the food (breakfast only) is very limitted in range and####[]
quality- for 6 euros you would be much better visitting on of the many local cafes.####[]
Not so charming####[]
It was nice that the hotel had an old charm feeling####[]
but underneath it all it was run down and dirty.####[]
The girls staying next to me found cochroaches in their bathroom.####[]
Our room did look into a small bricked in hallway that was a bit strange.####[]
I had to have my door card reactivated every time I came into the hotel for 5 days straight which became very annoying.####[]
Wanted to leave 2 days after getting here####[]
Well, I am staying at the Bahia Principe right now####[]
I am leaving not tomorrow but the day after.####[]
Ive been counting the days.####[]
They say when you dont have anything good to say, dont say anything, so I wont say anything.####[]
Location the best in San Fransisco.......####[]
We stayed at the holiday inn from 6-13 nov 2004,the hotel is an average 3 star but the views from the hotel are second to none.####[]
If possible ask for a bay view room on a high floor,the views of the bay are breathtaking.####[]
The best thing about this hotel is the location,across the road from Portsmouth Square,the heart of Chinatown,a 5 minute walk to North Beach the Italian district and 15 minutes either direction walking to the shopping district of Civic Square and the tourist thoroughfare of Fisherman,s Wharf,definately 10 out of 10 for location.####[]
For breakfast i would reccomend the Garden Restaurant outside the hotel,on the left,as breakfast in the hotel is overpriced and poor,similaly if you need a camera film etc the hotel shop is way overpiced so walk across to Chinatown and get your goods in the shops there.####[]
We would stay here again but that is down to the location,the best in San Fransisco,rather than the hotel itself...........####[]
Nice but noisy Very mixed feelings about this hotel.####[]
Don't need to dwell on the positives (look  feel, location, very friendly service) as they're all pretty much covered in the previous reviews..####[]
The big downside is noise.####[]
Both from outside the room (the noise from the pool can continue late into the evening), and from the thunderous air conditioning unit which you have no choice but to use, given the heat and humidity of the N.O. summer.####[]
Notwithstanding this, I would probably stay here again.####[]
But if you're a light sleeper and you're travelling in the summer months, I would recommend you look elsewhere.####[]
Fantastic value We were very pleased with this hotel - granted the rooms are not that smart and the decoration is a bit old but everything was very clean and comfortable the lobby, pool and staff are all lovely and the breakfast buffet was just amazing (although quite expensive!)####[]
The free pool towels were very welcome and the housekeeping staff responded immediately when we had a problem with an overflowing cistern!####[]
It is a good 20 minute walk from all the action but during the day walking along the beachfront to the art deco area is lovely.####[]
If you are averse to noise though make sure you ask for a room high up as the bar in the lobby is very noisy!####[]
Great City Centre Hotel Having just had a 3 night stay at the Park Plaza####[]
I can't understand why it gets such bad reviews.####[]
It is a typical city centre hotel and everyone should bear in mind that it is 80 years old and so doesn't have the modern look of some of the newer hotels in Boston.####[]
The staff were always happy to help, the room we had was large, very clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a great location for seeing all Boston has to offer.####[]
I would most definitely book here again.####[]
Majestic indeed!####[]
I really enjoyed our stay here.####[]
We booked at a great rate and upon checking in, received a great room: corner with a balcony.####[]
The room was beautiful, the view from the balcony was great, and the bathroom had the best shower we have encountered so far in Europe.####[]
The staff was helpful and the location was fantastic...walk to the Gaudi sights and some of the best tapas bars in the city.####[]
MICE PROBLEMS####[]
The W Hotel has really gone downhill since its change of owners.####[]
Used to be an okay hotel with balinese style decor.####[]
Now the decor looks old and is in need of updates, they have scimped on wait help so the service is extremely bad and THEY HAVE MICE PROBLEMS!####[]
A bit scary as we were coming home from dinner one night, a small little creature went scurrying across the floor to our horror!####[]
Do not stay here.####[]
not too shabby sharing a room with a pal, it cost us 拢2 each per night which is really quite reasonable for a nice hotel.####[]
beds were comfy and food was nice.####[]
staff were a little rude though and beer was about 拢4.50 a pint.####[]
Bus into central amsterdam was worth it for the savings we made id say.####[]
VIEW ROOM IS A MUST####[]
The view rooms here are amazing.####[]
Request a high floor, looking out, all you'll see is water.####[]
Gives you that cruise ship effect.####[]
Rooms here are small but nice and comfortable.####[]
Also like most Kimpton hotels, it hosts a wine hour, in which they serve wine and beer complimentary.####[]
good hotel####[]
The Sheraton was a good hotel to stay at.####[]
I will stay again next year when we go back to Boston.####[]
We booked a room in the south tower because of reading this site.####[]
The room was fine and the location was great.####[]
The only negative was that the shower/tub needed to be updated.####[]
lovely decor####[]
We had a quiet room on the top floor-####[]
we called it the penthouse.####[]
The decor was lovely and the glass lift well was amazing.####[]
It looked into the courtyard where breakfast was served.####[]
Loved It Myself, my son and daughter and two of their friends stayed at the St. James and we loved it.####[]
They would have liked a larger pool, but we really didnt have that much time for swimming anyway.####[]
The rooms were large, clean and had a wonderful atmosphere.####[]
We go to New Orleans several times a year and usually stay at another hotel, but this one is perfect and with in walking distance of all our favorite attractions.####[]
This is our new hotel of choice.####[]
Barcelona Gem####[]
In the heat of Barcelona and the noise of the bustling city, this lovely little hotel was pure heaven, set right on the front of Port Vell, only 10 minutes from the beach, Las Ramblas and the Barri Gottic district, you really couldn't wish for a better location.####[]
Polite staff, peaceful surroundings, cool settings, pool deck on the top floor to cool off in the hot afternoons.####[]
I have to say that this hotel made our stay near perfect.####[]
We will definately go back to this hotel again.####[]
Nice, clean, and a great place for families.####[]
Nice location within walking distance of the Space Needle.####[]
We had a 2 bedroom suite which we felt was a great price for the location.####[]
Free breakfast is your basic continental plus waffles, although there were long lines for this.####[]
The free parking was a real plus.####[]
I stayed at other hotels downtown that charged $25 a night.####[]
Loved Alam Kulkul We stayed our last night in Bali at Alam Kulkul, as soon as we entered the room, we liked it, even though our room was on the very last corner , but the atmosphere inside was homey, it was not modernly designed or looked new, but very comfortable.####[]
I think it was because the room was bright.####[]
We also tried their Jamu Spa treatment : Hot Stone massage and Warm tea leaves Facial which was divine.####[]
We definitely will come back to Alam Kulkul in our next trip to Bali, and that time we would like to try their villa, which we're sure that is well groomed too, just like their hotel room.####[]
We highly recommend alam kulkul to everyone.####[]
A Perfect base We have just returned from our first NY visit and stayed at the Casablanca for four nights, largely on the basis of good reviews.####[]
We were not disappointed.####[]
The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms which I had read were small were no smaller than most city hotels ,Rick's Cafe with the complimentary breakfast, all day tea/coffee muffins newspapers and evening cheese####[]
/wine was an oasis of sanity and the location is very convenient (walkable for most first visit sightseeing).####[]
We would strongly recommend this hotel unless you want the fitness club/swimming pool/restaurant type experience of a large chain hotel.####[]
The Best Wonderful location; convenient to midtown without being in the awfulness of Times Square.####[]
Knowledgable and friendly staff.####[]
Only problem-####[]
it is expensive.####[]
Plus side- it is worth it.####[]
perfect Mu husband####[]
and I were on a short layover in London and we stayed here for one night.####[]
We will be back!!####[]
Great location, it is only on one floor next to another hotel.####[]
Private, quiet, wonderful service and very spiffy decor!####[]
Look on the internet for good deals####[]
Overbooked ?!?####[]
First we were quite pissed about the fact fact that we booked another hotel and had to stay in your hotel.####[]
But the nice room, very friendly people (specialy matthieu Croisiez) and good location let us forget this very soon.####[]
So no comments at all and we have hade en excellent weekend.####[]
Thanks!####[]
grate service I stayed at wyndham miami airpot 3 nights for my work.####[]
The hotel located few minunts from the airport.####[]
the southern rooms have the view of the nice golf and water.####[]
i mostly want to share my highly satisfaction from the service and kindness of the staff everywere in the hotel including tansportation.####[]
the room is big and convenient with every thing you need for business or vaction.####[]
I had good time with my friends crouching at the pool with good sigar and drinks at evening when it cooled down with light velvetly breeze, listening to latin music and splashing water nearby.####[]
Loved The Belvedere!####[]
We loved The Belvedere!####[]
Because of its location, we were able to walk to theaters, restaurants, Times Square, and the sightseeing bus terminal to pick up tickets.####[]
The hotel staff was extremely accommodating.####[]
We would stay there again for sure!####[]
Excellent Hotel####[]
This was my family's second stay at the Baglioni.####[]
The staff was quite helpful and the rooms were beautiful.####[]
The hotel is located just a short walk to many of Florence's best sights and is connected to the train station via an underground walkway.####[]
I highly recommend this property.####[]
Time Square Treat Just back from a 6 night stay at The Muse.####[]
Great location, fabulous restaurant and bar, clean comfy fully-equipped room, what more can you ask for!####[]
Staff were very friendly, allowing us an early check-in and offering some tips on theatre tickets etc.####[]
Only slight problem - our room was on the 7th floor facing the street - little bit noisy, but hey its NYC.####[]
Our superior room had a huge king size bed, great mini-bar, huge bathroom with tub and shower and all the little extras you expect - steam iron, hairdryer, lots of towels etc.####[]
Can't recommend the hotel enough.####[]
Ok location, great hotel Spent one night at the hotel with my wife.####[]
The room is neither luxurious nor large, and the bathroom is also small, but the hotel and room were new, very clean and larger than some we had seen on the internet, judging by the photos.####[]
It even had a nice view of one small charming canal.####[]
The staff was also very polite and helpful.####[]
This hotel is not so well located as the Centraal Station Ibis, but is close to the metro and you get very fast to the heart of the city.####[]
Really enjoyed the hotel, the rate was 89 euros.####[]
Fabulous Classy Hotel####[]
This is a fantastic hotel, Reception were so friendly, supplied us with maps and even highlighed places of interest.####[]
The breakfast is lovely and very varied.####[]
The rooms are beautiful, spotlessly clean.####[]
The pool and roof bar are lovely and give you fantastic views of the cityOnly slight negative is there are bars beside the hotel, it's not soundproofed enough so the sound carries and can disturb you through the night.####[]
Highly recommend this hotel if you fancy a relaxing base for sightseeing!####[]
amazing holiday where the bad reviews come from for this hotel####[]
i do not know because i had a fantastic time in this lovely resort.####[]
the food was beautiful, the scenery was lovely and the staff are amazing, utterly amazing.####[]
they would get games of football going or volleyball or take you away to learn spanish or do a poolside game, the bar staff are all lovely, waiters in the buffet area were very hardworking where nothhing was too much hassle.####[]
all the differant workers here wear uniforms so you know exactly who to see about anything.the pool was great with balls supplied and goalposts in the pool and on the beach, from my room both the pool and beach were less than a minutes walk away.####[]
best holiday i have ever had####[]
Bad experience This hotel is terrible.####[]
My friend booked this hotel for me for the night of March 13,2007.####[]
However, when I reached the hotel that night around 11:40pm due to delayed flight, I was told my room reservation was cancelled.####[]
They did not arrange me to another room or hotel.####[]
This is a terrible experience happened to me.####[]
I will never live in this hotel again.####[]
Great hotel####[]
We just got back from a four day stay at the Affinia and we just loved it.####[]
The room was the biggest and best####[]
we have ever had there was even a pillow menu!####[]
The staff was helpful and pleasant.####[]
Highly recomended.####[]
Elegant bargain Lovely hotel, clean and new due to recent remodelling, which seems to be completed.####[]
(As of 12/07 there is some construction on the east side of the hotel, but it does not affect hotel access.)####[]
Breathtaking views of Hudson River and WTC site.####[]
Close to Tribeca, subway, and steps from train station at WTC.You can get great deals directly from their website, probably to build up business again after remodel.####[]
Highly recommended.####[]
racking Hotel !!####[]
Second time have stayed at this hotel and won't be the last.####[]
The rooms are very clean and it must be the nicest bed linen ever.####[]
The breakfast buffet is very adequate to start your day and the staff are very pleasant and helpful.####[]
Well done Room Mario####[]
Mate- Excell####[]
l, Relaxing Modern Retreat####[]
This was our 2nd stay in as many years at Bravo Beach Hotel and once again it was a wonderful time.####[]
Thomas, the manager, and the rest of the staff are fantastic, the property is fabulous, and the two restaurants are excellent!####[]
I love the sleek design of the rooms (very caribbean modern), the intimate size of the hotel (only 9 rooms), that almost every room has a view of the ocean, the ipod docks in the rooms, the 2 pools (one with a bar where you mix your own drinks!) and the groovy music that plays on the property all day long.####[]
It's just a very cool, relaxing setting with no pretense.####[]
We love it and look forward to returning next year to BBH!####[]
Okay####[]
Okay, for basic accommodations.####[]
The pool was nice and it was close to everything.####[]
Parking is a problem.####[]
Superb value The Upstalsboom Hotel Friedrichshain provides superb value to a visitor to Berlin.####[]
Located near the metro station, it serves as a good starting point to reach Alexanderplatz, Zoogarten, KaDeWe, Brandenburg Gate, Sony Centre, etc.####[]
The attached restaurant serves hearty breakfasts.####[]
There are trendy bars, pubs, and bistros nearby that are away from the usual tourist spots.####[]
The rooms are spacious and bathrooms are spotless.####[]
fantastic hotel I went to Barcelona last year with a group of mates and we stay at the vincci arena for 4 night.####[]
This is great hotel, very clean and rooms beautifully decorated.####[]
The staff were very friendly and i could,nt ask for more.####[]
Location very good and metro only round the corner.####[]
For value and quality this hotel is very good.####[]
Perfect place to stay This hotel was absolutely fabulous.####[]
The room was spotless, the king size bed was comfortable and the location was magnificent!####[]
It was in a very safe neighborhood and within walking distance of great restaurants and shopping, plus the bus stopped right down the street.####[]
Gary was a great help in securing our shuttle to the airport and helping us with places to eat.####[]
The hotel was very quiet as it was at the end of Lombard street.####[]
Great place to stay and the price was right.####[]
loved it !!!!####[]
The rooms are very comfortable and clean ,I loved the modern look and the wooden floor.####[]
The Staff were extrimly nice####[]
they helped us with information about the city and with reserving places in nice restaurants .Its####[]
been a wonderful stay and I highly recomend it.####[]
One of the few good ones Great service, unbeatable location...where in Europe you have to struggle to fit into the 2x4 bathroom space, this hotel has a great bath, close to Leidesplein (1min walk) Tram 2/5 stop right outside, also close to all museums...####[]
bars/clubs...####[]
Best to book on priceline, select 4 star and put a price of $80-90/night, more than likely you will get this, its one of the very few 4 star hotels in AMS taht is on priceline.####[]
They even have a turndown service!!####[]
Enjoy!####[]
Excellent location and staff We stayed at the Prestige for 3 nights dutring our honeymoon and loved it.####[]
The location was excellent and the Ask Me Service was so helpful.####[]
Alvaro from the service recommended our 2 favorite restaruants from our whole trip: Con Gracia and El Nou Ramonet.####[]
Both delicious and great experiences.####[]
We would highly recommend the hotel!####[]
High marks to the Antiche Figure####[]
We were delighted to stay at this hotel.####[]
Location is very convenient to Venezia Santa Lucia train station and it was a great relief to get off the train, cross the bridge, and get to our hotel so fast.####[]
The reception staff was charming and very helpful.####[]
The room was very clean although not very spacious.####[]
Breakfast in the tables that face the canal was a big plus.####[]
LOVED this hotel####[]
We stayed at this hotel on May 10, 2004.####[]
It was beautifuly decorated, clean and the staff was wonderful.####[]
I felt very safe in this area of the quarter and if I came back to N.O.####[]
this would be the only place I would stay.####[]
bugs and dirty bed bugs-black bugs --in the bed under the sheets and the housekeepers were not surprised and they did nothing to help the situation.####[]
silverfish in the bathrooms.####[]
dirt and grime on all kitchen counters and tables.####[]
dirty floorsFor $111.00 plus tax, it seems good for 2BR and 2 Baths, kitchen and terrace.####[]
Bring your own bug spray and windex####[]
and you'll be fine.####[]
great location and good value####[]
We were pleased with our stay at the Hotel Kapiolani.####[]
It was only $83a night and for that price, it was clean, the location was great, thepool area was very nice as well as the lobby.####[]
We stayed only 2 nites,but it was just what we wanted for the extra time in Hawaii.####[]
You can walk one block and you are at the major Waikiki beaches and shops.####[]
It is not luxurious, but I would stay there again.####[]
couldn't be Better!####[]
We couldn't fault this wonderful condo.####[]
After reading lots of reviews of lots of places, I'd have to say that everything was excellent (except for the American fondness for dim lighting!)####[]
(I had to remove the lamp shades so we could read).####[]
No elevator queues, friendly competent staff in all areas, gorgeous condo, great location and views, masonry construction (so no noise transference between condos) - no street noise with doors closed.####[]
We had been staying on the north shore in a house I'd booked over the internet, and it was ok at best, so finding accommodation in Waikiki Beach Tower at the last minute was fantastic.####[]
Wonderful stay in a great neighborhood November 30, 2007####[]
We've just returned from a six day stay in London.####[]
The Sumner Hotel was just lovely.####[]
It was in an excellent location, close to the Marble Arch Tube, a selection of restaurants and shops, and nice walking tours.####[]
The room was very warm and inviting, and staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with directions and maps.####[]
We would no doubt stay here again.####[]
Fantastic Palace Just back from a long weekend over Paddy's day and####[]
this hotel is up there with some of the finest i have ever stayed in.####[]
The staff were all more than happy to help and always met us with a smile.####[]
The hotel is fantastically placed 1 block from 5th Avenue and about 5 mins from Central Park.####[]
Food was excellent, however, we preferred to eat out just to make the most of the trip.####[]
Great hotel but look around the web and see if you cant get it any cheaper than you find at firs####[]
l hotel, great value Very nice in every way, cool decor, definitely above usual 3 star standard, we're used to 4 or 5 star hotels and this fit the bill.####[]
Roof top pool and bar area is lovely and amazing views, go up at sunset as the lights on the huge fountain nearby go on.####[]
Not central but right across from metro station and on bus route, travel is no problem####[]
and I'm a great believer in not having to walk, save that for Las ramblas!####[]
Do not miss the light and music show at the magic fountains round the corner, very memorable.####[]
Will definitely stay here again.####[]
Excellent location; good value for money Very friendly and competent staff; very clean; free wifi access to the internet is a definite bonus; truly lilliputian rooms (at least the single room I had)####[]
but then this is Amsterdam...;####[]
breakfast OK but nothing to write home about; thin-walled####[]
so earplugs are a must if you have no desire to listen to your neighbour's tv programmes; overall good enough value for money for Amsterdam (in absolute terms though 90 euros per night is really expensive for such a small room...####[]
it really is just for sleeping and showering ;) )####[]
Southern Decadence (Labor Day) at 555 Canal Steet####[]
Was thrilled finding a sandwich deal for $99ea here for 3 nights of Labor Day weekend -started at Days Inn then Ramada Bourbon after.####[]
The 2 towers made me dizzy but the rooftop pools in between are pure heaven.####[]
The room was custom tailored, neat and perfectly appointed, albeit it's an unbeatable location if the lobby's like a hangar.####[]
A changed man, nowadays I prefer a boutique inn or continental elegance.####[]
Elevator Safety Issues!!####[]
All three of the south bank of elevators malfunctioned the entire four days we were there!####[]
One group of guests was stuck in elevator #3 for over an hour and a half.####[]
My wife and I got stuck between floors twice in elevators #1 and 2 two days in a row when the electronics suddenly just went dead.####[]
After fiddling with the buttons it started up again each time after about five minutes.####[]
I believe these sorts of maintenance/safety issues are unforgivable in a hotel this expensive and we will not be staying there again!####[]
Great trip, great hotel####[]
This is a great hotel - it was superbly located by the flower market and the staff were all extremely friendly.####[]
The room was clean and the shower was the best I've ever found in a hotel.####[]
Because it was so centrally located it was little noisy at night####[]
but it wasn't a real problem.####[]
Overall, I would definitely stay there again.####[]
Green credentials This is a new hotel that claims a range of green features, some of which seemed to be stretching the point somewhat.####[]
However it was a pleasant stay with particularly firendly and helpful staff.####[]
Minus points were the size of the bedroom (small); a sliding door on the bathroom that didn't have any pretence at privacy; high bar prices ($14 for a glass of wine) and exorbitant parking charges ($37 per day) when there were public facilities on the same block (for $24####[]
a day.)Overall, good but not exceptional enough to make me want to go back.####[]
Darrin, the bar steward would make me want to go back though, just for the entertainment value.####[]
He was a scream!####[]
Sleeping Easy in the Big Easy####[]
After getting a great rate on Hotwire ($103 for three consecutive nights during a convention) I was very pleased arriving in a traditional W hotel.####[]
It had all the things you expect to find: a hip rockin' lounge, stylish goth lobby, and a surprisingly friendly and inviting staff.####[]
Even with a Hotwire booked reservation, the staff honored my platinum Starwood membership and upgraded me to a huge suite (three of us got upgraded separately).####[]
The room was typical W, meaning all the comfort you expect (big, soft bed with great linens, awesome shower, and####[]
plasma TV's).The staff was always gracious and trying to help.####[]
Great hotel, fab location We stayed 4 nights at the Vivaldi last weekend and had a great time.####[]
The room was spacious very clean and comfortable, the location was great ( great for museums and sightseeing, right next to one of the main stations and on one of the main streets but they have very good sound proofing####[]
so you would never know!)There####[]
are a few decent eating/ drinking places literally over the road, built under the railway.####[]
a couple are German style and one is Italian - we ate at a couple of them and they were really good (you do get the thunder of trains every so often tho!)I would also recommend a meal at Dressler on the Unter den Linden (about 5 - 10 mins walk away)####[]
it's very nice and the staff are lovely.####[]
ute hotel and great location####[]
I stayed at the QT during the Christmas - New years week of 2005 with my wife.####[]
We both really liked the design and coziness of the property.####[]
Also, it is located just a 30 second walk from Times Square.####[]
The staff is helpful and there are deli's a minute away.####[]
Overall, I had a great time here and would highly recommend this hotel.####[]
lean but Noisy Reasonably clean, great location by attractions but horrifically noisy, both from street traffic and denizens of the hotel itself.####[]
Staff was very nice.####[]
Room cleaning products very smelly, so be careful if you are sensitive.####[]
Parking an issue - not enough spots by the end of the day.####[]
Bottom line: because it was so much less expensive than any other property in the area (approximately $100/night less) we would likely stay here again if we couldn't find a better deal elsewhere.####[]
Excellente Excellence####[]
Punta Cana is soooooooo amazing.####[]
The grounds are beautiful and the staff are wonderful.####[]
The Entertainment team is great, especially Franklin.####[]
He showed us a great time!!Definately a recommended place for a romantic, adult only vacation.####[]
