Paper thin walls stayed at the stamford on sat 19.4.08 after dropping brother at airport, reception was friendly enough but room seems dated even after reno's and beds are hard and pillows terrible.####[]
the worst thing was the noise from the adjoining room which started at 12 at night till at least 3am rang reception and asked if they could do something about it which involved knocking on the door and being told by guests next door to [--] off and then giving up, was offered another room####[]
but as my 1 year old daughter had just gone to sleep after 2 hours of being kept awake by the noise i couldn't see the point i asked again for them to do something about the noise and the rang them and no change####[]
i rang again at 3 in the morning to be told there was nothing they could do about it and to see the duty manager in the morning.next morning at check out after no sleep i asked for the duty manager and told him my concerns, his reply was to offer free parking at a value of 10 dollars, i laughed as i thought he was joking after paying good money for no sleep####[]
he said the best he could offer was 2 free breakfast in there restaraunt which is about what soggy cold bacon and sloppy eggs are worth.for anyone wanting to stay at a decent hotel at the airport pick the holiday inn####[]

Excellent hotel in central Beijing Had an excellent stay at the Wangfujing Grand.####[]
At check-in, the clerk asked me if I wanted to stay in an improved room (at a higher rate of course).####[]
I declined and was upgraded into an executive suite, which gave me access to the executive lounge and breakfast.####[]
The staff at the hotel were excellent, always available and courteous.####[]
The hotel is well situated, within walking distance of the forbidden city.####[]
Plenty of restaurants in the area.####[]
Friendly, quirky and great location Rooms are nice but small.####[]

Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment, but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes, and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes, which improved the whole situation.####[]
The hotel is really quite plush, the rooms had everything we needed, and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free!####[]
The staff were very helpful, and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go.####[]
The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others,but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day, and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water, wasn't to be turned down.####[]
It is definitely a hotel I would visit again, particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years.####[]

Great, eccentric but click hotel####[]
I read one of the below reviews expecting the dylan to be past its prime after the changeover from ANoushka Hempel, shabby rooms, etc but was very pleasantly surprised.####[]
I went to amsterdam, a city i love and have visited many times for work and for pleasure, with a new partner - we were really surprised by the polite and professional (not at all snobby) service, great room service, great cocktails in the bar, and best of all, a great room.####[]
Booked a cheap (鈧?30) rate off the internet and was expecting a broom closet, but the room was very nice, large (by Amsterdam standards), loads of character, clean, kept-up-looking, just very very cool.####[]

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton-family properties, and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay, it was hardly worth the price paid.####[]
Good points: very friendly staff, and terrific restaurantBad points:####[]
the room was dated - old rundown furniture, warped bathtub, stained bedding.####[]
I was only offered a double-queen suite in the main building, which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements.####[]

Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned.####[]
Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street.####[]
Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room.####[]

Give It A Miss####[]
The hotel is in a great location, but I would have serious doubts in recommending the hotel as there are several deficiencies that need immediate attention.####[]
Hotel is in need of some seious maintenance i.e. broken counter tops, leaking taps, no self closing room doors, window locks not working and musty stench from stairwells.####[]
There is no parking at the hotel and runs $18 - $25 per day plus tax.####[]
No High Speed Internet access at all is available, you have to cross the road to a sister property's lobby and pay $10 a day.####[]
Had a bad experience with a rude staff member while checking out, but that hasn't swayed my review.####[]

most inaccessible hotel of the world####[]
This is an example of a poorly planned, new hotel tower on top of an old department store.####[]
To get to your room requires 2 different elevators and a hike across the lobby.####[]
Pity of you arrive by car; NO PARKING ; NO CAR DROPOFF.No Taxis either at most times!Getting luggage in and out of the place is next to impossible.####[]
The restaurant is way undersized and gets overrun during peak periods; better use one of the local coffee shops (also less $$$).####[]
Great Room, Good location!####[]
We stayed here and would recommend.####[]
This hotel has a ultra modern interior which we liked.####[]
Check-in was ok as we had an upgrade to a suite which was a nice surprise, It was a fantastic room, actually it was more like an apartment,, it was that big!####[]
The room had been cleaned to a high standard and the bed was really comfy.####[]
Loads of nice restaurants and bars nearby too.####[]
Excellent Boutique Hotel We selected the Hotel Elysee for our 10 year Anniversary.####[]
We have stayed at other upscale hotels in the city but liked the warmth and the intimacy of this property.####[]
The staff was very gracious and welcoming.####[]
The only minor difficulty was getting a taxi for dinner.####[]
(Leave extra time for the bellman to hail you one!!!)We will definately return to this hotel.####[]
A Room is a Room####[]
This is a great place to stay as long as you don't plan on being in your room the whole time - the rooms are small but nicely furnished and the bathrooms are clean.####[]
The location is ok - close to Sentosa access but a little further from other attractions such as Chinatown and City Centre - but these are very easily reached by the MRT.####[]
If you are planning a holiday where you stay in your room - spring for a place with bigger rooms.####[]
Great place to spend the night if only have a quick stop over and money is important!####[]

Great value for money and one stop from Hollywood Myself and three of my friends stayed at this Hotel as part of a miniature Californian tour.####[]
It was clean, the staff were friendly and I did not notice any noise from the motorway.####[]
The reason I chose this Hotel was its relatively close proximity to Hollywood.####[]
There is a five minute walk to the subway/rail station and then one stop####[]
and you walk out right at the Chinese theatre, this was perfect for us as we went out clubbing at the Tropicana and the Roosevelt Hotel.####[]

Will definitely use this hotel again, saves all that trawling round the internet.####[]
Ideal base for a night...####[]
Only stayed the one night, as part of the extension to our Minicruise, and thought it was quite an alright hotel, considering it wasn't too expensive.####[]

Breakfast was continental style, was quite average.####[]
Would return to the hotel again.####[]
Highly recommended I don't understand how this hotel could get any bad reviews.####[]
My girlfriend and I stayed here from March 22-25, 2005 and found everything more than satisfactory.####[]
It has a great location, great price, friendly service, and a good breakfast.####[]
We didn't have any problems with making reservations or having clean rooms as was reported by other reviewers.####[]
The only complaint I can think of... it was my understanding that parking was included, but we had to pay $7 a night instead.####[]
This was still cheaper than any public parking in the area or compared to other hotels in the area.####[]
Fantastic stay####[]
This is the second time my wife and I have stayed at the hotel and we would live there if we could.####[]

After renting a car and heading out on a road trip of northern spain decided to book our last night here as well.####[]
