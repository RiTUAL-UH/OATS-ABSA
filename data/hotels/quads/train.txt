The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel, or the best equipped or in the best location####[]
but it did offer friendly and efficient service, a very modern and up to date decor, large and comfortable rooms, all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops.####[]

Breakfast that ran till 11.00am just in case we'd had a late night, a sun terrace on the roof with a (small) pool and gymnasium, although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife.####[]

Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment, but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes, and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes, which improved the whole situation.####[]
The hotel is really quite plush, the rooms had everything we needed, and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free!####[]
The staff were very helpful, and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go.####[]
The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others,but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day, and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water, wasn't to be turned down.####[]
It is definitely a hotel I would visit again, particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years.####[]

Great, eccentric but click hotel####[]
I read one of the below reviews expecting the dylan to be past its prime after the changeover from ANoushka Hempel, shabby rooms, etc but was very pleasantly surprised.####[]
I went to amsterdam, a city i love and have visited many times for work and for pleasure, with a new partner - we were really surprised by the polite and professional (not at all snobby) service, great room service, great cocktails in the bar, and best of all, a great room.####[]
Booked a cheap (鈧?30) rate off the internet and was expecting a broom closet, but the room was very nice, large (by Amsterdam standards), loads of character, clean, kept-up-looking, just very very cool.####[]
I'd not hesitate to recommend the dylan especially as there are not too many options in AMsterdam for characterful, stylish hotels.####[]

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton-family properties, and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay, it was hardly worth the price paid.####[]
Good points: very friendly staff, and terrific restaurantBad points:####[]
the room was dated - old rundown furniture, warped bathtub, stained bedding.####[]
I was only offered a double-queen suite in the main building, which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements.####[]

Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned.####[]
Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street.####[]
Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room.####[]

Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used (think they may have gone out of business now as can't find them any more) to the Hotel Piet Hein.####[]
When we arrived thought nice hotel, only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel's annex which was a few doors down the same street.####[]
Absolute nightmare of a room , up three flights of very steep stairs , room very dirty , ripped curtains , mould in bathroom , stained carpets , etc .####[['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'very dirty'], ['curtains', 'room_amenities quality', 'negative', 'ripped'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['carpets', 'room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative', 'stained'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'Absolute nightmare']]

Give It A Miss####[]
The hotel is in a great location, but I would have serious doubts in recommending the hotel as there are several deficiencies that need immediate attention.####[]
Hotel is in need of some seious maintenance i.e. broken counter tops, leaking taps, no self closing room doors, window locks not working and musty stench from stairwells.####[]
There is no parking at the hotel and runs $18 - $25 per day plus tax.####[]
No High Speed Internet access at all is available, you have to cross the road to a sister property's lobby and pay $10 a day.####[]
Had a bad experience with a rude staff member while checking out, but that hasn't swayed my review.####[]

most inaccessible hotel of the world####[]
This is an example of a poorly planned, new hotel tower on top of an old department store.####[]
To get to your room requires 2 different elevators and a hike across the lobby.####[]
Pity of you arrive by car; NO PARKING ; NO CAR DROPOFF.No Taxis either at most times!Getting luggage in and out of the place is next to impossible.####[]
The restaurant is way undersized and gets overrun during peak periods; better use one of the local coffee shops (also less $$$).####[]
Great Room, Good location!####[]
We stayed here and would recommend.####[]
This hotel has a ultra modern interior which we liked.####[]
Check-in was ok as we had an upgrade to a suite which was a nice surprise, It was a fantastic room, actually it was more like an apartment,, it was that big!####[]
The room had been cleaned to a high standard and the bed was really comfy.####[]
Loads of nice restaurants and bars nearby too.####[]
Excellent Boutique Hotel We selected the Hotel Elysee for our 10 year Anniversary.####[]
We have stayed at other upscale hotels in the city but liked the warmth and the intimacy of this property.####[]
The staff was very gracious and welcoming.####[]
The only minor difficulty was getting a taxi for dinner.####[]
(Leave extra time for the bellman to hail you one!!!)We will definately return to this hotel.####[]
A Room is a Room####[]
This is a great place to stay as long as you don't plan on being in your room the whole time - the rooms are small but nicely furnished and the bathrooms are clean.####[]
The location is ok - close to Sentosa access but a little further from other attractions such as Chinatown and City Centre - but these are very easily reached by the MRT.####[]
If you are planning a holiday where you stay in your room - spring for a place with bigger rooms.####[]
Great place to spend the night if only have a quick stop over and money is important!####[]

Great value for money and one stop from Hollywood Myself and three of my friends stayed at this Hotel as part of a miniature Californian tour.####[]
It was clean, the staff were friendly and I did not notice any noise from the motorway.####[]
The reason I chose this Hotel was its relatively close proximity to Hollywood.####[]
There is a five minute walk to the subway/rail station and then one stop####[]
and you walk out right at the Chinese theatre, this was perfect for us as we went out clubbing at the Tropicana and the Roosevelt Hotel.####[]
Overall this Hotel provides clean accomodation and serves perfectly as a base for those who wish to go out drinking in Hollywood.####[]

The airport bus ( 1 stop from the airport ) dropped us close to the hotel ( 400m ) from Placa d Espanya , situated on a very quiet back street but close to two metro stations ( the best way to get around )  .

Perfect end of summer break Great Hotel, really good service from the staff.####[]
Loved the outside pool and the breakfast buffet was plentiful.####[]
Small ish rooms but good sized bathroom and who on earth is going to do spend time in the hotel room in Barcelona.####[]
So much to do.####[]
Will definitely use this hotel again, saves all that trawling round the internet.####[]
Ideal base for a night...####[]
Only stayed the one night, as part of the extension to our Minicruise, and thought it was quite an alright hotel, considering it wasn't too expensive.####[]
Location was good, but a little hard to find!####[]
Breakfast was continental style, was quite average.####[]
Would return to the hotel again.####[]
Highly recommended I don't understand how this hotel could get any bad reviews.####[]
My girlfriend and I stayed here from March 22-25, 2005 and found everything more than satisfactory.####[]
It has a great location, great price, friendly service, and a good breakfast.####[]
We didn't have any problems with making reservations or having clean rooms as was reported by other reviewers.####[]
The only complaint I can think of... it was my understanding that parking was included, but we had to pay $7 a night instead.####[]
This was still cheaper than any public parking in the area or compared to other hotels in the area.####[]
Fantastic stay####[]
This is the second time my wife and I have stayed at the hotel and we would live there if we could.####[]
The location is fabulous and the owners are extremely helpful, friendly and informative.####[]

I honestly don't know what else I could recommend in Manhattan unless you are looking for more of a party scene (gansevoort) or even more luxury (lowes regency, morgans group, etc).####[]
