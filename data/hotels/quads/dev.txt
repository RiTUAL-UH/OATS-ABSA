Excellent Hotel, very helpful staff We booked this hotel on Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights before our cruise.####[]
The hotel has one of the best overal in Barcelona, within a few yards to the underground, five minutes walk to Las Ramblas and five minutes walk to the beautiful modern port area where there are endless walks and pleasure boat trips available.####[]
We were going on a cruise and needed a taxi to get to the cruise port (12 - 20 euro, depending on the driver).The trip in from the airport cost just over 30 Euros and takes about 20 minutes depending on traffic although evening rush hours can take over an hour easily.####[]
The hotel staff were excellent and they offer free WiFi access or broadband using their own business centre if you do not carry your own laptop.####[]
The breakfast buffet in the hotel is a bit limited but if you purchase breakfasts for the full duration of your stay it will only cost 9.50 Euro and is very reasonable as the food is of good quality although the hot items are a bit limited.####[]
Or if you prefer there are plenty of restaurants and bakeries within a few minutes walk.####[]

Loved the Marriott Marquis New York Stayed at this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor.####[]
The hotel was fantastic we were made to feel special, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.####[]
We had a Time Square view at no extra cost, the room was huge with sofa's and chairs, the bed was huge clean linen every day.####[]
We had concerns about the lifts after reading some of the reviews####[]
but I don't think we ever had to wait more than a minute for a lift.####[]
The hotel was a joy and will definately will be staying there again.####[]
Luxury with a view Spent three nights here during our honeymoon, and the staff went out of their way to make it special.####[]
The room was excellent with a fabulous harbour view.####[]
As far as accommodation and service were concerned, it's one of my best hotel experiences.####[]
The only downsides to our stay were (1)####[]
the dinner in the hotel's haute cuisine restaurant, Petrus, which was good, but not good enough for the prices charged (our best meals in HK were in Nobu and in M at the Fringe); and (2) the afternoon tea in the lounge in the Shangri La, which didn't live up to the standards of a five star hotel.####[]

Most Disappointed Having seen all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the previous couple of months, we booked The Chancellor for four nights at the beginning of September.####[]
Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations, and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising.####[]
We were incredulous that when we arrived, the doorman stood and watched whilst we carried our luggage in without even opening the door for us.####[]
This attitude, combined with unfriendly staff on the front desk and a very tired and shabby looking bedroom, led to a disappointing stay at The Chancellor.####[]
We would not recommend staying at this hotel.####[]

Our Home in Florence####[]
This hotel feels much more like a home than an institution--for us, that feeling came from the moment we met Carmel, who grew up in Boston, and she invited us upstairs onto her lovely outside terrace.####[]
Located near enough to the train station to be convenient for travel but on a side street, Hotel Il Bargellino is also near to several Florentine sights.####[]
Our only complaint was that the noice from the street can be a little annoying late at night, but it's a trade-off for being right in close proximity to so much.####[]
Carmel enticed us as customers by helping us find the best accomodations in her hotel, and we will stay here again upon our next trip to Florence.####[]

loved the Eastgate Tower!####[]
I stayed at the Eastgate Tower with a large group of girls for a reunion weekend.####[]
We wanted to stay somewhere that would accommodate all of us in one room and the two bedroom suite was more than enough space for us.####[]
The furniture was a little outdated, but the room was clean and the hotel staff were extremely pleasant and the prices were great!####[]
I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone.####[]

Farjardo Inn, San Juan PR - Worth####[]
the Money Farjardo Inn - San Juan PR - Worth the moneyOctober 24, 2006TripAdvisor Member, Waco TXThe inn and grounds were prettty and well kept.####[]
The room was not fancy, but was large and very clean and comfortable.####[]
This hotel is not on the beach but a beautiful beach is very near by.####[]
The only problems we encountered were very few signs directing us to the hotel and when we called the first time, the desk clerk was unable to give us directions from the town plaza which was less than 1 mile away.####[]
There are a lot of steps and steep inclines on the property, but overall it was well worth the money.####[]
It needs to be closed 1####[]

Great stay at San Gallo Palace####[]
My mother and i took a trip over the new year periodthe hotel was excellent,rooms very clean and spacious.####[]
Breakfast was ample and the bar very nice to come back to at night for a little night cap.####[]
All the staff were very friendly and would recommend this hotel to any one.####[]
Try the little restaurant Alfredos whick is very close by you wont be disappointed####[]
Good-sized clean rooms but service could be improved We booked a standard room at the Villa Mazarin.####[]
We found it centrally located (we walked to most of the major tourist sites) and the rooms were decent sized and comfortable.####[]
What let it down somewhat for us was the service at the front desk####[]
- they were by no means rude, but made you feel like you were bothering them if you asked them any questions.####[]
If the service were more personable and efficient, then we would have had no complaints about the Mazarin.####[]
Practical hotel with great location####[]
My friend and I stayed there for two nights.####[]
I love the location of the hotel, close to the Sol Metro station and walking distance to almost all major tourist sites.####[]
Room is clean but has thin walls, we heard showers from next door and cleaning noise (sweeping and vacuuming).####[]
Staffs are very helpful in general.####[]
A good stay A three day stay on business .####[]
Got a good rate at $129 per night.####[]
Nice clean and spacious room, must have been upgraded recently - good standard of furnishings, LCD TV with HD channels.####[]
Hotel location is good, close to Union square etc.####[]
I would stay again, helpful staff .####[]
Gem of a hotel####[]
This is a particularly agreeable hotel with friendly staff, nice furnishings, and excellent value for money given the included breakfast, wine/cheese evenings, and coffee and tea on-tap, so to speak.####[]
Our petite double room was, as expected, space-challenged, but clever use of the available space minimized the bother, and for a 2-night stay it was not a problem.####[]
For longer stays, I would invest in a larger room.####[]
Particularly appreciated was the ability to set up my laptop and connect to the internet for free without having to re-arrange the furniture, unplug lamps, and so on (which is so often the case at more expensive hotels).The lounge on the 2nd floor is a lovely space to relax, and the bar on the top floor is also worth a visit (or two).####[]
