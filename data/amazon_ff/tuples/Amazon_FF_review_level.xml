		<text>I think that Kelloggs Frosted Mini - wheats is absolutely wonderful because it ' s sweet and because it ' s filling . I have it every morning . It is so full of fiber that it makes for a breakfast that will stick with you for a morning free of cravings . The best part of the 58 . 8 size of Kellogs Frosted Mini - Wheats is that it has two complete bags of cereal inside . Love it !</text>

		<text>I ' ve always liked balsamic vinegar . in salads , with fruit , and anything else that suits my taste at the moment . I rec ' d this particular balsamic vinegar as a birthday gift from my sister . . . as the previous reviewer said , this is like no other balsamic . If you want a new taste experience , give this a try !</text>

		<text>I have always purchased Kirkland Extra Fancy Mixed Nuts because of their high quality and taste . Even as the price continued to climb . But the quality and freshness is now on a downhill slide . The mixture has changed to mostly cheaper nuts . They advertise macadamia nuts but only a few small pieces in the container . I will be looking elsewhere - - no longer wanting to pay premium price for mediocre products .</text>

		<text>I usually have these after dinner and its pretty nice . Doesn ' t have a clean ( refreshing ) after taste as I would have expected from a herbal mint tea but its fairly ok . My dad who doesn ' t usually drink tea loves this stuff too . If you don ' t mind minty taste though , this product is not for you . I like the fact that its herbal and does not have caffein in it . a tremendous flavor . hot enough to make you break a sweat . the best sauce that i have ever used . not for the timid . my first time in famous dave ' s restaurant , i knew this was for me . the price through amazon is a great savings .</text>

		<text>I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say . The coffee inside was good , as well . However , to break it down - - it was one of the smoothest coffees I ' ve ever had , like drinking silk . The flavor was mild , pleasant , but for me , the taste was too bland , did not stand out . Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore , not ultimately satisfying . I do feel there are others , though , who would appreciate a coffee lite .</text>

		<text>I was referred to this particular chai after trying another that was just too weak and boy was I disappointed . I ' m not sure what these other people are use to , but this brand of chai was WAY too sweet . It was as if someone dumped a half cup of sugar in there . I was so looking forward to this and just couldn ' t choke down even one cup . I ' m going to leave the entire box on the counter at work and hope it disappears .</text>

		<text>This is a good idea in theory , especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks . Unfortunately , as much as I wanted to like these , they didn ' t taste like food - hard to describe , but the ' primal ' branding doesn ' t help as I did feel like I was eating something I wasn ' t supposed to . While the first one I tried was novel , I easily tired of them and then plain got grossed out by them . I won ' t be getting these again .</text>

		<text>Great shipping , timely . However , beware of the label ( not listed on the Amazon . com ad ) that these are very small pill pockets ( barely big enough for one little tablet ) . They are not the product we thought we were getting &quot; for capsules &quot; . It ' s hard to see that with the information they give you on the web .</text>

		<text>This product retails at $ 4 . 99 . I assumed the price was due to the description saying the shipping weight was 6 lb , meaning I would received a larger amount . Clearly it was not 6 lb given that the bottle is under 1 lb . Basically , you end up paying well over 2 times what you should - $ 12 . 99 for 12 ounces .</text>

		<text>Organic and provides protection against unwanted bacterial growth . I just place some on my daily dinner for its benefits but it never tastes or smells like the fresh ones that I get from my garden . Basil is not an easy plant to deal with except during summer so this is the best that I have got so far . Bravo .</text>

		<text>I just finished this coffee which was fine if you like a medium dark roast , nicely mannered , moderate taste to offer just about everyone . Good choice as a coffee nobody will dislike yet not a flavor for those who like a really strong wake - up . Good for an afternoon &quot; Kaffeestunde &quot; entertainment . But I am not likely to reorder it since I like the much darker , oily , stronger flavor coffee bean . The parrot picture on the bag is nice too to look at . I ' ll try another Camano Island coffee next time but know I can always come back to this one without risk if need be .</text>

		<text>This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried . At first she seemed to like it , and she ate it well . After a couple of packs ( 12 cans ) she refused to eat it at all . This was not the only flavor she was given during this time , but she knew when it was part of her meal . I don ' t know what happened , but it is not on our menu any longer .</text>

		<text>The Sans Sucre Lemon Mousse Mix is a very good tasting and light diabetic friendly snack . The lemon flavor is not overpowering and doesn ' t have a &quot; fake &quot; taste that other diet products seem to have . The suggested serving size is a little small as we got 3 reasonable size servings instead of the four indicated on the packet . We also discovered that if you over whip it , the mousse mix makes a nice topper as well . We also like the Sans Sucre Mousse Mix - Chocolate Cheesecake a lot ! Recommended !</text>

		<text>I ' m a big fan of these snacks and have been giving them to my Lab for over a year . They smell awesome and I must admit that I have personally tried a few of the flavors . They do smell better than they taste , but they are not half bad . They are quite healthy and priced well . I dropped a star since these are not my dog ' s favorite treats .

		<text>I plan to use this in place of canola oil . I just switched to a low - carb diet and this was a recommended product , but I don ' t know that I would ever want to use anything else ! It was all liquid when I opened it up though , not sure if it was just a warm day since it says it is supposed to be solid at less than 76 . Really good quality stuff , and that is a lot of oil for $ 25 . 54 oz )</text>

		<text>I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X - Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock . The Slim Jims have a good flavor , but they are far more greasy , and their casing is tough , like eating wax paper . They are also a bit more &quot; dried out &quot; in consistency . I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims . X - Sticks are less dry , far less greasy , and more tender to chew .</text>

They immediately loved munching on them in between meals and on long rides in the car . We took it a step further at home for lunch .

		<text>Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint . According to the label , this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk . It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber . For 210 or 250 calories , I think it should have more flavor , but for those who don ' t like any sugar in cereal , this works out well , especially if they prefer a high - fiber one . Personally , I wouldn ' t purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste .</text>

		<text>This is seriously the best tasting protein drink I have had , hands down ( and I have tried a LOT of them ) . I can ' t recommend it enough . It ' s got a very nice strong coffee flavor ( if it ' s too strong for you , just add more water or milk ) and gives a nice little caffeine punch - great alternative to the vending machine for the afternoon blahs . The Blender Bottle makes it perfectly . Having tried a single serve sample , I am now buying two canisters . one to keep at home , and one to keep in my desk at work .</text>

		<text>Since cats are obligate carnivores , high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy &amp; healthy . When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain , useless fillers and by - products from their formulas . My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more . Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new . This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago .</text>

		<text>After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure , he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill ' s Science Diet k / d dry food , but he was vomiting it up regularily . Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot ' s Stew . My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken , turkey and salmon varieties . Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots , peas and green beans , but he does eat them . I really like that Spot ' s Stew is an all natural cat food with no by - products or fillers , and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys .</text>

All of them go &quot; nuts &quot; when we put down the &quot; pasty Kongs &quot; for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do ! I would highly recommend all of Kong ' s &quot; tasty pastes &quot; - it ' s easy to use , doesn ' t seem to make any mess , and is a great extra treat for dogs . Our 3 give it &quot; 2 paws up &quot; !</text>

		<text>Greasy and tasteless / bland but edible . Sediment in bottom of bottle . Loose fitting composite cork bottle stopper . Hoping against hope that the Picual or Hojiblanca ( one of which actually has some chunks of olives in it ) tastes better ( tastes like olives ) . On the brighter side BJ ' s Rozzano brand ( which we consume a lot of ) tastes pretty good and is reasonably priced .</text>

		<text>I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy . Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers .</text>

		<text>Please be aware that one of the cans that I purchased in late August 2011 exploded in my cupboard . This indicates a potential health risk to consuming the contents . Information printed on the can bottom identifies the batch , as follows : &quot; 1219BestBy05Dec2012 , 1035 C3 340 10 . If your can is deformed , consider discarding orreturning it , rather than eating it . Also , aside from the problem of exploding , 1 / 2 cup of this product contains 860 mg of Sodium . The amount that I ate in another can was way too salty for my taste and amounts to more than half of my personal limit of 1500 mg Sodium per day .</text>

		<text>This product moisturizes very nicely . It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile . I really wanted to love this cream , but the smell is just so overpowering . I was expecting a soft , light scent , but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy . The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it ; I put the cream on before bed , and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on . It ' s very unfortunate , in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable . amazing very pleased and came very fast . they are also very big . 4 different colors . green , orange , red , yellow . 240 came with it</text>

		<text>These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the &quot; all natural nothing fake of phony &quot; as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear &quot; all natural no fake flavors &quot; - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside</text>

Eating a casserole or pasta dish with this salt is horrible - - it ruined the dishes because it was so gritty . I prefer not to feel like I am chewing something that sand was sprinkled on .

		<text>I ' m still disappointed with the &quot; lower sodium &quot; label . Of course you will get less sodium if you decrease the amount in the cup by 50 % ! The large Mc Dougall soup cups contain two servings typically - have you tried to share one or keep it for another day ? My solution is to use about 3 / 4 of the &quot; seasoning packet &quot; ( assuming that the sodium is there and not in the dried flakes ) . The flavor and texture are still good . I wish their advertising was more transparent - it would make me trust the company a little more .</text>

The peanut flavor is strong , there ' s no oil separation ( so no stirring is necessary ) and the texture is very creamy / smooth . As far as differences between this and the &quot; natural &quot; offerings of other brands , as long as we stick with the creamy variety my kids can ' t tell a difference . so we don ' t mind changing it up with whatever is on sale .

		<text>I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread . I have finally found one which is up to my standards and which makes a truly fine loaf of sourdough bread . This unbleached flour is made of red wheat , so the color is beautiful and makes a rich light brown loaf . The grain is uniform and fine and it is delicious . So many flours today are completely lacking in flavor so that even with sourdough they come out tasting like cardboard , but this makes a full - some and hearty bread . My strongest recommendation .</text>

It may take a minute to get used to the flavors , only because they are so authentically fruity , they don ' t taste like the overly sweet gummis you are probably used to , but they are definitely worth a try . These are different then the original German version of Goldbaren , these are the Saft ( translated as &quot; juice &quot; in English ) bears . The original Goldbaren are much more similar to the Gold Bears sold in the US . These taste more like actual fruit and come in different flavors : black currant , apple , lime , raspberry , pear , and peach .</text>

		<text>This is my favorite energy bar . Most of the time I prefer to eat real food , but there are occasions ( long hikes , motorcycle trips ) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished , and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up . I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I ' m not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos . I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors  no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary , and no preservatives .

		<text>I am not , as a rule , a big fan of herbal teas , but I ' ll give anything a try . Lipton ' s Blackberry Vanilla Tea , in its distinctive pyramid shape , allows the full essence of both flavours to circulate and infuse into a truly enjoyable tea experience . The scent alone is warming and peace - inducing , and holds a chilly day at bay . This is the tea I would choose , with a little honey , for days when I ' m feeling under the weather . This is a great addition to your tea inventory .</text>

		<text>I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon . My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico , One , then Vita Coco . Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said , I will pass on that . I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably . I would rate this behind One for taste . I like the convenience of having it in a can but the cans look somewhat dirty compared to ones normally used for soda .</text>

		<text>I picked this up at a food store when I was in either St . Louis or Chicago . I LOVE the different spices , but it ' s soo hot ! I would like it to be 50 % less heat , but the same wonderful flavor . I crave this flavor on chicken , but in the future will have to make my own jerk . And fyi , I LOVE hot and spicy food . . .</text>

		<text>I love the taste of pop - chips but , I think it is a little too salty . The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked , tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience . I think they woul ' ve been better served keeping the salt content low . I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn ' t suffer from the same problem . the worst I think is the sour - cream ( or something like that ) flavor . This one is ok .</text>

		<text>I would love Saco Mix ' n Drink even more if only it were organic ( grass fed , non - drugged cows ) , but I called the 800 number on the box , and was told that they had not yet reached that level of purity . I still use it in spite of that little fault , putting it directly from the box into my tea , and into any recipes calling for milk . I always add more of it than the recipe calls for ( ie : recipe calls for 1 / 2 c . milk - I add twice as much powder to the water . What I like best : it dissolves instantly , with no lumps !</text>

		<text>Nabisco ' s Newtons Fruit Thins are an interesting creation , and they were nice to sample . I like the flavor - - it ' s mild , not super - sweet and would actually be a great choice to have with coffee or tea . The fig pieces are a little hard , but I suppose I ' d rather them at that texture than to be super - soft . The package has lots of servings , so one purchase should last you a while . Based on my experience with this flavor , I ' d like to try the others as well .</text>

		<text>If you have a Bialetti Mokka or Brikka , I would recommend this coffee . I personally use a stove top Bialetti Brikka , and this coffee makes a fantastically smooth tasting , yet strong espresso with the most crema of any commercially available canned coffee I have tried . And I have tried quite a few ! If you want a great cup of espresso , or cafecito as they say in Miami ' s &quot; calle ocho &quot; , without using a commercial espresso machine , do yourself a favor get a Bialetti Brikka , and try this coffee .

		<text>I really love these . After trying many different brands I decided that this is my favorite . They are soft and fresh - tasting , and also come with lots of liquid . They are also from domestically caught fish , and even though canned in Asia , the cans are BPA - free which is not common in the industry . The lemon juice helps a great deal with keeping your breath fresh ( usually an issue with sardines ) and the lemon slice found in each can is an added and very enjoyable bonus .</text>

One bar has 150 calories ( 30 from fat ) and 9 grams of sugar ( versus 16 in the old Cocoa puffs cereal and milk bars ) . The texture is different , it looks more like cocoa krispies than puffs and my jaw hurt from chewing so much but overall it is a nice option for people ( especially kids ) who don ' t have time to have a sit - down breakfast in the morning . i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest</text>

		<text>Finally , someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor . If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil , top 3 being french fries , donuts and potato chips . Your body has a tough time breaking down the oil once it ' s fried . So the Popchips are an excellent option for potato chip lovers . though I prefer the Chili Lime flavor over the Sweet Potato ) .</text>

		<text>I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said &quot; mostly &quot; excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .</text>

		<text>Delicious ! Amazon is the only place I ' ve been able to find grade B maple syrup in reasonably small containers . It has considerably more intense maple flavor than grade A . The usual assumption is that grade A is better than grade B but unlike eggs or meat , the grade refers to when the syrup is harvested , grade B being the more intensely flavored . Makes pancakes and waffles worth getting up for !</text>

		<text>This is my favorite GF pancake mix so far . I love Pamela ' s Baking Mix for nearly everything else , but Bob ' s is my favorite pancake mix for sure . They are thinner than wheat pancakes , but have a nice texture if you don ' t try to make them too thick , which tend to get dense . Granted , homemade GF pancakes are usually a cut above the mix , but who has time to whip up homemade pancakes before work and school each morning ? These please my family just fine !</text>

		<text>This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them . We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags . The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal . The chips are so delicious , baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt . They have 0 fat , no preservatives , nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients . What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip ! i was introduced to these chips by a friend . i couldnt find them local , so i got them here . they are the BEST chips super addicting . even my sister who gags at the taste of onions LOVES these chips . the delivery was speedy and it is well worth ordering a box . super tasty !</text>

		<text>The texture is like jell - o pudding and the flavor might be a poor semblance of a butterscotch - scented magic marker . It ' s gross . I thought artificial flavor had developed - the Extra gum dessert flavors are remarkably accurate - but Walden Farms evidently doesn ' t have the same R + D budget as Wrigley . I don ' t generally mind low - cal alternatives . but this is disgusting .</text>

		<text>I got this as a gift . I didn ' t think I ' d like it as I am not much of a coffee drinker . Mixed with a splash of skim milk and some artificial sweetener this was the best coffee I ' ve had in a long time ! we had been looking for King B brand jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened . They informed us that their Smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the King B products . With speculation on them keeping the same recipe , we orderd a jar and were not disappointed ! ! The product was exactly what we had remembered the original King B to be . I will definetly be ordering this again ! !</text>

A little pricey and contains a fair amount of broth - but the quality seems much better than other cat foods and the extra liquid has been good in the hot summer weather . He likes most food from Weruva - but this seems to be his favorite . Worth the extra cost .</text>

		<text>If you ' re ever in the need for an exotic alternative , in your regular soup routine , then try Nile Spice soups . Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry , turmeric , and other East / West Indian spices . Although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true Indian ( or Caribbean ) curry dish , the soup is still a delicious meal . As a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate ( MSG ) , I am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive . The soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at 30 % ; however , most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile . Try the Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup today and be whisked away into a unique aroma from half way around the world .</text>

		<text>We get large bags of mixed frozen fruit , fill a Vita - Mix to nearly the 1250ml line , add water just to the top of the fruit sometimes we add mixed berries with the fruit ) , then add the Nutiva Hemp Protein Powder ( we use a heaping scoop ) . Sometimes we also add in some chocolate mix , sometimes a little maple syrup , it just depends . There ' s a distinct but not bad taste at all , and it cuts the &quot; just fruit &quot; taste of the smoothie . We buy it mainly for the nutritional specs , not the taste , but don ' t find the taste at all disagreeable , ourselves . We ' ve also tried the chocolate version - GREAT taste .</text>

		<text>I live in the area where these cookies are made , and I remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago - - each one was wrapped in saran wrap and had a handwritten label on them . The packaging has changed , and there are many different flavors available now , but the original breakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones did . The smaller size is great for a snack , as the large ones are enough for two people ! Full of good stuff , not too sweet . it ' s a treat that you can feel good about .</text>

		<text>If you are used to eating regular peanut butter ( like JIF or Peter Pan ) , this will probably not be palatable to you . If you are used to eating natural PB , then you will likely appreciate this product a bit more . I bought this yesterday out of curiosity , and it is quite delicious . I LOVE PB , but try not to eat too much because it is so calorie dense . I like to get my healthy fats through nut butters , but some days you want to spend your calories on other foods . THis is GREAT to put into a protein shake or smoothie without adding 200 calories and I just had some on my lightened up french toast ( low cal bread , egg whites &amp; sugar free syrup ) and it was delicious !</text>

		<text>I use this every time I go to the gym . It ' s one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee ( which I like ) , for caffeine , and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout , plus ease the acid build - up in the muscles that can make you want to puke . Make leg and intense workouts easier . I don ' t see the point in having the caffeine in the drink when the caffeine will not really get into the system until your workout is almost done . I tend to drink some caffeine half an hour before the workout and then use the Cytomax during the workout .</text>

		<text>I actually stopped using my Keurig coffee machine for several months before finding these tasty SF Bay fog chasers . Now I ' m using my k - machine nearly every day again and loving it . The best part of these k - cups is they ' re not made entirely out of plastic like all the rest . I do think that the &quot; all plastic &quot; k - cups affect the overall taste of the coffee . The fog chasers have a &quot; filter paper &quot; bottom that contributes to a much more authentic brewed coffee taste . Great deal and a great cup of coffee ! ! !</text>

		<text>I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them . Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks . I nearly broke my front tooth ( at least it felt that way ) biting into them . I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off , but it ' s not worth the toothache . Try the other flavors , they are good but think twice about this one .</text>

		<text>We have used &quot; A Taste of Thai Peanut Sauce &quot; mix for about 5 years now . Mixing the packet with one can of coconut milk makes it is so easy to use . The taste is pretty good with a bit of spice . Of the prepackaged peanut sauce we like this one the best ( our favorite was discontinued 5 years ago ) and we have tried LOTS . It is great to pour over vegetables , meat , and rice . Even my kids all like it .</text>

		<text>When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean . What I opened this morning was not what I had expected . To be clear , I was greatly dissapointed . I found bits of husk from the bean , which doesn ' t make coffee , and is considered filler . The flavor left something to be desired as well , it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid . I was hoping to leave a great review of this product , but honesty forbids it .</text>

		<text>Why my dog loves these , I will never know . They arrived in a timely manner but were not packed in a smell friendly bag . When opened the envelope I was almost knocked over by the stench . Plus , although they were very long and med thickness ( not as thick as they suggest ) he ate it in less than ten minutes . I will probably get them again for him since his teeth are really sparkling .</text>

Although the cereal was still good , I do not like how much sugar is in it , nearly 50 % by weight . I guess it isn ' t surprising why it is so tasty .

		<text>This turned out to be a very tasty dish . It says just add beef , but you will also need to supply the rice or potatoes for it to go over , there is quite a bit of sauce . It has a thick spicy curry flavor and I found the longer the rice sat in it the better the taste  so you might want to add the cooked rice right to the pan instead of over the top . Very good , will make this again . this is my drink of choice . I ' m addicted . I drink 3 - 4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good . I ' ve tried other chai - spice teas ; none of them compare . The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it , raising the prices . You should try it , it ' s good .</text>

		<text>Our dogs ' diet is largely people food as my brother spends his day cooking . However , we always put out a bowl of good dry dog food for them when they aren ' t interested in our meals ( been on a low red meat quick lately to keep the cholesterol under control ) . Although the ingredients aren ' t quite as good as the premium brand I ' ve been giving them , I certainly don ' t consider it poison as some reviewers have stated . If soybeans are good enough for menopausal women , why would you think it ' s going to harm your dog ? It might cause bloating but it won ' t kill them . So I give it a three as adequate and the dogs seemed to enjoy it .</text>

		<text>This is the original blend from Starbucks and it ' s not sold in all areas . For those of us who can ' t get to a Costco or find a store that carries this , this is a perfect find . This is a purchase from the Costco stores , you get two tins in each order and each tin is 2 . 5 lbs . Though a bit pricey this is a much better mix than you can find in the average grocery aisle amd it makes great mocha ' s and cocoas .</text>

		<text>After receiving this coffee I made a few cups . It was fairly smooth , not too overpowering , and had a slight mocha aroma . It ' s OK coffee . I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones . To gauge my review for others , my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop , Green Mountain Dark Magic , Coffee People Organic Bold , Emeril ' s Big Easy Bold , and Tully ' s Kona Blend .</text>

		<text>I like this onion soup as well as other OSEM products such as vegtable beef and mushroom soup . I don ' t actually drink them as soups . I use them when I cook and the recipe asks for an added soup . These products are loaded with flavor enhancers . That ' s fine , because that ' s what I am looking for .</text>

		<text>Everytime I run out and get regular kibble or cans , my cats look scruffy and they seem to hate the store - bought stuff and hate me for feeding it to them . On this food for years , my cats are shiny , never gassy , never fat though I leave the food out all the time in a bistro feeder , and their poop ain ' t sweet but seems less foul than when on other food . Only down side is that you have to remember to reorder it 2 weeks before you run out because it ' s not in any stores . It ' s not cheap but with 2 cats a 40 pound bag ( $ 90 including shipping ) lasts me about 12 weeks , so under $ 4 a week per cat , maybe $ 2 more than Purina , $ 1 more than Iams and about the same as Blue or Nutro .</text>

		<text>These Barksters by Loving Pet are the the only product on their line that is made in the USA . My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China , I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet ' s many other products until they are made in the US . As for these Barksters , they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients . All of my picky Chihuahua ' s love the treats , or I should say they loved the crumbs . I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all broken up and were in crumbs .</text>

		<text>These pops were absolutely awful . My first try was the German Chocolate Cake , which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy . The second try was the Cherry Cheesecake , which tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup . The third attempt was the Coconut Creme Pie , which had a mild coconut flavor . I gave up after the third attempt and shared a few of the remaining pops with some coworkers ; most of them hated the pops as well , stating they tasted very artificial . I was very disappointed considering other products of this nature appear to have higher ratings .</text>

		<text>We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as &quot; extra bold &quot; produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you . We love it and make sure we always have some on hand .</text>

		<text>While I have several of the Torani brand sugar free syrups at home , and love them all , I would have to say out of all of them , the mint one isn ' t &quot; minty enough , &quot; especially considering I ' m using it as an add in to coffees or actual recipes . In short , I find the minty - ness a bit muted and diluted when in a mixed drink . Torani provides a flavorful , sugar - free alternative . All their syrups are of high quality and consistent . But the mint one , IMHO , isn ' t my favorite , even though I want it to be .</text>

		<text>We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions . Simple Solutions is the way to do this , and for a dog with irritable bowels , it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food , instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog . The dogs love the taste , and Wellness brand is excellent quality .</text>

		<text>Instead of coming in a nice bagged package , as the picture shows , I received 4 mylar balls shoved loose into the mailing envelope . There was no sign of the original packaging . They were crushed flat and ripped in several places , and appear to be old and dusty ( possibly used ? ) The balls were so badly flattened that I could not return the balls to a &quot; round &quot; shape even when I tried reshaping them . It may seem petty to complain about packaging for a cat ' s toy , but the items recieved were NOT as pictured , and were squished entirely flat and all 4 of them were torn . I was very disappointed that I did not even receive new - looking items from this seller for the price I was charged .</text>

		<text>I do love the original Cheetos Cheese Puffs , but not the fact my fingers end up covered with the orange - colored coating on the puffs . I have eaten several bags of Barbara ' s Bakery Gaked White Cheddar Cheese Puffs and was disappointed at not being able to detect white cheddar but the puffs are very light with a pleasant flavor . They have a light crispy crunch to them and can be eaten without a beverage as they do not seem dry to my mouth . It would be difficult to eat just a small quantity of them , but I found them to be a delicious , non - filling snack as well as being healthier than the fried kind . I will certainly order them again in the future .</text>

		<text>I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet . It ' s soft enough to roll out or shape for making fruits or other decorations , but still holds its shape as it dries out . It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months . The 7 oz . tube is fairly small and I wish they made a larger size , but the multipack is a nice option for this reason . I ' ll be buying this brand again .</text>

		<text>I ' m into flavor and have no interest in the art and ritual of tea making . This is good tasting tea and can handle milk or cream , I guess that ' s the point with breakfast teas . If High Tea is your thing then I ' m sure the Keurig is a big turnoff . However for me , the Keurig can make a cup of coffee , a cup of decaf and a cup of tea in under three minutes . Great for a crowd .</text>

		<text>These seasonings ( other flavors : Tuscany &amp; Rosa Maria ) there is also a Parmasan blend , but the first 3 are my personal favorites , are absolutely DELICIOUS ! ! ! They are also very versatile , you can have them with olive oil for bread dipping or better yet , use them to cook chicken , ground turkey burgers , fish , just about anything you can think of . I ' ve tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money , you get a lot more seasoning and a TON more delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob ' s seasoning collection .</text>

Lurpak comes fairly close in taste , but Plugra has more complex , tangy flavor I crave for . Other European butters tast flat in comparison .</text>

Not as salty as some other brands , with firm flesh and delicate flavor , it ' s a real treat on a salad , with crackers , in a fresh - bread sandwich , or straight out of the can on a camping trip or picnic . Or , serve with coffee , juice , eggs and crumpets ( or English muffins ) foran old - time British - style Breakfast , like I had on a trip to England many years ago .

		<text>I received a keurig Coffee maker for Christmas and enjoy the ability to have fresh brewed coffee with little or no waste . However . I felt being able to use my favorite coffee would make this product even better and maybe save some money . I sent for and have used My - Kap for about two weeks now . The machining and fit of the reuseable caps is good but the cleaning out of old k - caps is tedious and messy and somewhat defeats the purpose of the Keurig Machine . I do like to reuse and not waste and in this regard the My - Kap product is a good one for a low price .</text>

You can tell it is authentic , not flavored with artificial , chemical flavors , because you can see actual truffle shavings in each bottle . We ' re so pleased to know that we ' ll be able to replenish our supply on Amazon , rather than having to contact the company in the UK .

		<text>If you ' re looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea , it ' s probably not a good idea for you to purchase this ( especially 6 boxes of it ) . The tea ' s flavor is dominated by ginger , and some lemongrass , with barely any green tea taste . That ' s right , not lemon , but lemongrass . Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled &quot; lemon ginger green tea . It doesn ' t necessarily have a bad taste , just an unexpected one . If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor , i prepare this with another plain green tea bag .</text>

This oil is very similar . The only thing I didn ' t care for is the bottle design because it is impossible to pour without it getting some product on the outside of the bottle , leaving a sticky mess .

If you are into heavy , dark roasts like French , Italian , or Sumatran , then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste . However , I love it . Unfortunately , the one - star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee . don ' t follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you ' ll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this &quot; soup &quot; tolerable . i didn ' t fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price . not even close .</text>

		<text>My daughter eats one of these bars almost every day . She had to go gluten - free last year and this was the first treat we found that she really liked . She takes them to school for her snack and doesn ' t care that the other kids are getting things like animal or graham crackers . I like them because they are healthy and portable . I keep one in the car and one in my purse for emergencies .</text>

		<text>A friend recommended I try this and it was very good tasting coffee . A smooth after taste and a kind of woodsey flavor . Some other coffees I have found that are great are the Wegman ' s dark roast espresso beans ( which I brew lightly ) and also the medium roast regular coffee at panera Bread . Just thought I would throw that in as a bonus . LOLNice coffee .</text>

		<text>We love this pesto sauce mix and it ' s hard to find at our local grocery store so I get it from Amazon . This is the only pesto mix that my kids like ! ! They ' ve eaten it since they were small and now they want it at college : No spinach in this one ( Knorr ' s has that ) so it ' s a simple basil product . If we don ' t have time to puree basil leaves or find the right spices , this package mix is a great substitute .</text>

		<text>This drawer is a great space saving idea for k - pod storage . Our machine is on a very small counter next to the fridge . This drawer allows storage of a good number of pods without taking up much more space than the footprint of the machine itself . Tip for heavy drinkers - to get one more pod per slot , invert every other pod in the line . If you notice , that ' s how many boxes of pods are packaged .</text>

		<text>I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth . I do not understand why these are so hard to find , as even other web shops appear to no longer carry these , it ' s a shame : (</text>

		<text>Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth . I ' m assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth . We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn ' t eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time . Regardless , I would never purchase this product again because I don ' t want to risk my cats getting sick from it . We are trying other brands of kitty grass to see how the will work - we ' re trying to satisfy their craving for greens so they will stop eating my houseplants .</text>

		<text>This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic . I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality , but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup . Neither has added ingredients , preservatives , or residual pesticides to my knowledge . So while I love this organic version , I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative , unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind . it is a really great product . it helps me stick to my diet . just run water over the noodles and your good to go . you can put them in anything you want . definitely worth the try . they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making .</text>

		<text>It seems the almond &amp; apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way . I was happy with the less - sweet version , but the taste is still divine . The kids ' favorite are the fruit &amp; nut , but this is a close second .

		<text>If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further . This coffee comes perfectly pre - ground for espresso drinks . This espresso has a smooth rich flavor that is not too strong with a hint of a chocolate aftertaste . Warning after you drink this coffee a couple of times you will be hooked . If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt ' s , the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has . EnjoyJohn S .</text>

		<text>I keep buying a bag every year to see if they have changed their methods of production but as the saying goes &quot; you get what you pay for &quot; . This used to be a great product but starting a couple years ago they stopped screening it . It is now at least a quarter woody material , 1 / 4 - 3inch pieces . This would actually be great for mulching trees and shrubs if it weren ' t way to expensive for that purpose . Spend the money , buy pro - mix and save yourself a lot of time and problems .</text>

If you ' re expecting thick chocolate - y syrup , you need to lower your expectations , but if you ' d like a sweetener with a chocolate kick to it and you ' re avoiding carbs , I recommend this and any of the other Torani sugar free flavors ( my faves are caramel , peach , and strawberry ) .</text>

		<text>I ordered Tully ' s plain House Blend Extra Bold which is super , but received something different that tastes stronger and not as good . I received Tully ' s House Blend Extra Bold &quot; Melange maison &quot; instead . The carton reads House Blend , but the cups inside have the Melange label . The plain House Blend is much better . I ' m disappointed .</text>

		<text>This is a great hair oil . Not too greasy , but enough to keep my hair well - tamed . And the ingredients look good , except for the mineral oil perhaps . It has a noticeable smell that is not as overwhelming as that of some other hair oils I have tried , and it does not linger as much after application . But I would have liked it to not have any smell at all .</text>

		<text>This is a great tasting gluten - free corn flake cereal . I like the fact that it is also organic and is offered at a lower price than what is available locally . The fruit juice sweetened taste is not too sweet but just right for my taste buds . I enjoy other Nature ' s Path cereals , too . The company does a good job making delicious cereal products for those sensitive to gluten .</text>

Overall , the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre - packaged K - cups . It does not compare to the Tully Pre - Packaged French Roast that I am used to drinking . As noted by other reviewers , I don ' t know the Eco friendliness of the packaging , since you are trading out a small plastic cup for a small plastic pouch .

		<text>McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world . But Vanilla isn ' t a bold new taste sensation ; it ' s a , well , plain - vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity . A baker needs their extract to be consistent , flavorful , and ( unless you are made of money ) inexpensive . This is all three . This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle . You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it ' s the &quot; default &quot; brand of vanilla extract in the US , the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it , or something like it .</text>

		<text>One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .</text>

It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings . Add leftover chicken or beef , and some vegetables , and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs .</text>

The subtle scent and flavor of jasmine is just right , and added with a bit of lemon ( increases the anti - oxidants ! ) and honey , you have the perfect cup of hot tea .

		<text>The flavor is very rich , but cripes is it potent . You only use about 1 / 3 the quantity to get the same strength . The flavor is somewhat like chocolate , not bitter at all . Chicory is not coffee , hence no caffeine , which is either good or bad , depending on your preference . Overall , I like the flavor , just be careful when you start to make it . If you put in the same quantities as regular coffee , it will turn out like syrup .</text>

		<text>Even though I hate sugar in any coffee beverage , this is pretty good . At 45 calories a can , there are probably 3 teaspoons of sugar . That ' s kinda hefty , but it doesn ' t taste that sweet . While it has a pretty strong flavor , it certainly doesn ' t have the robust , fresh ground flavor one may expect from Illy . And , it tastes like it ' s been sitting in a can , because it has . Maybe they ' ll ship in glass and solve the metal aftertaste issue ?</text>

		<text>I ' m a bit of a cinnamon junky and have collected many variants of this tasty treat . There are a few better products but still I keep coming back to McCormick as it has been consistently good . The last couple orders of Indus Organics and Spicy World cinnamon I bought from Amazon had all the flavor of hardwood flooring ( these are much more expensive products ) . I love to boil or pressure cook 6 or 7 sticks and mix with black tea for a killer batch of ice tea . The only reason I dogged Amazon a star is the fact you can often buy the same 8 - oz McCormick cinnamon sticks at Costco for half the price . Still , great stuff and I ' ll be back for more .</text>

		<text>This review is some research about whether or not this product is actually rapadura . Although this product is indexed under &quot; rapadura , &quot; which is a Portuguese name for dried sugar cane juice , this company ( Rapunzel ) used to sell a product that is specifically labeled &quot; Rapadura &quot; ( see below ; also Google &quot; rapadura &quot; for more info ) . In researching whole cane sugar , brown sugar , and sugarcane , etc . , on Wikipedia , &quot; rapadura &quot; is the name used in Brazil , Argentina , some other South and Latin American countries and the Caribbean , whereas &quot; panela &quot; is used in Columbia , &quot; piloncillo &quot; is used in Mexico , and &quot; jaggery &quot; is used in India for what appears to be identical products - - unrefined , dried , natural sugar from sugar cane , minimally processed , with all the natural vitamins and minerals still intact . From the pictures I ' ve seen on Wikipedia and other websites , &quot; organic cane sugar &quot; is quite a bit lighter in color than rapadura , panela , jaggery , etc . , suggesting that is has be refined to some degree , like adding calcium carbonate to remove some so - called impurities . From Wikipedia entry for &quot; Rapadura : &quot; &quot; Despite the fact that rapadura is a very old foodstuff , predating even the colonization of Brazil , a German company called Rapunzel has registered the name as a German trade mark DE 1143537 , an event that has greatly angered Brazilians , as they see the name as a generic all - purpose word , like ' lemonade ' or ' sandwich ' . As of February 2009 , Rapunzel has removed the Rapadura name from their unrefined and unbleached whole cane sugar product sold in health food stores , though their website has not yet been updated to reflect this . &quot;</text>

I much prefer Stash ' s Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash ' s Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes . However , there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea . It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter ( by brewing it longer ) , a sign of a good quality tea . Recommended , especially if you enjoy a simple , basic tea .</text>

		<text>First of all , I hate buying bottled water because I feel like it ' s such a rip off when I can take a good hydroflask water bottle , fill it with tap water and ice cubes , and have long - lasting cold water . However , I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water . I can ' t really speak to the &quot; healthiness &quot; of it , but on pure taste alone , I would buy this water for a refreshing drink . The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here ( at least I couldn ' t perceive it ) and the water is so smooth ! This is stating the obvious , but it tastes better cool or cold and when it ' s at that temperature , I could not detect any aftertaste . I would buy Essentia at my local convenience store if they carried it !</text>

Imagine the BLANDEST chicken flavored Gerber ' s baby food and then add some water to it and call it soup . That ' s what this is . On the bright side though ( being stuck with a case ) , I do have a great opportunity to experiment with some of those free Penzey ' s spice samples and use up some of the overabundance of summer veggies to make this stuff edible .</text>

		<text>Still pretty yummy , even though they ' ve reduced the fat content , making it not quite as yummy as it used to be ( thanks nanny state [ big razzzzzberry ] . what more can I say ? Well , except that when it comes to my tastes and health , I ' d rather make the decisions myself , rather than having them dictated by the overzealous , bureaucratic , idiots in the government ! It ' s a quaint idea known as &quot; freedom &quot; and is not to be confused with the stupid &quot; progressive &quot; ideal of &quot; freedom from responsibility . Okay , I ' ll step down off my soapbox ( for a moment anyway . )</text>

		<text>When you open the package of this cereal , you can definitely smell a nutty aroma . The flakes are light , sweet , and nutty , and stand up pretty well to milk . The flavor is both sweet and nutty , though not overly so . I feel it is definitely different than what is already out there . If you like nutty , sweet cereal , this is a good one to try !</text>

		<text>Our vet recommended these pouches for our 2 cats to help them loose weight . Dry food is full of carbs , and he suggested wet food since it ' s mostly protein and fat - what they would be eating in the wild . Needless to say our picky felines love the food , their coats are shiny . and we ' ll see if they loose the extra lbs ! We ' ve also tried other flavors of this food , but this is their fave !</text>

		<text>This is definitely the best flavor of coffee that my wife and I have tried so far on our new Keurig . Not too bold , not too weak . The decaf version is great too for those late night drinks . We ' re both a big fan of hazelnut coffee to begin with so this was perfect . You can ' t beat the subscribe &amp; save price either .</text>

		<text>It ' s difficult to find Bob ' s Red Mill Light Spelt Flour in my area , so I have this product auto - shipped to my home , and use it just as I would wheat flour in most recipes . Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat , although it doesn ' t work for anyone with celiac - sprue disease . Because this flour does contain some of the whole grain , the products I bake with it are a little darker in color and slightly coarser in texture than something that is made with all - purpose white wheat flour , but we haven ' t found the differences to be objectionable . I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good alternative to wheat flour .</text>

		<text>I placed the order based on the good reviews here . Generally speaking , I like it especially the texture . It contains the right amount of moisture , not to dry , not to moist . However , I do believe it contains too much almond extract . It ' s too dominant in the smell and in the taste . It ' s hard to miss once you open the plastic wrap of the bar . these beans came FAST ! not to mention as soon as i got the package ( packaged very well ) and opened it up . you could smell nothing but awesome vanilla aroma . inspecting the beans through the resealable plastic vaccume packed bag they appear to be long , plump and in good condition . cant wait to use these !</text>

		<text>I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years . PB2 isn ' t a perfect replacement for peanut butter  but it has a natural taste to it , is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile . I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product . When turning PB2 into peanut butter , don ' t add too much water , or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted . In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread , I also put PB2 powder in smoothies , on cereal and with oatmeal .</text>

		<text>Very disappointed in this product ! Thus tastes nothing like the product sold in the 1 1 / 2 lb . bag that this company sells . Has an after taste that tastes exactly like artificial sweeteners . Checked the ingredients and sure enough there was an extra ingredient called &quot; natural flavors &quot; in the packets of Z Sweet that is not in the larger bag version . I do not recommend this product - go with the &quot; Wholesome Sweetness &quot; brand of Erythritol since there is no other ingredient listed in their product .</text>

Why would anyone continue using the &quot; white death &quot; table salt that is void of so many essential elements ? I also use this to make an all - natural facial and body scrub ! We should only &quot; feed &quot; our skin what we would put in our mouths ! exactly what i wanted . looks great and have had many nice compliments on it . It made a great mothers day gift , as no place around here sells anything remotely close to it . Yes the flower is not real as bamboo plants do not flower , but it does look nice . The plant is real and has grown since purchased and it still looks great</text>

Usually when you open a bottle it smells nice , on those 3 occasions ( in 3 different orders ) the juice smelled sour , kind of vinegary , and there was a large odd clump in the bottle . We , of course , threw them out and I am trying to contact the company and let them know about this because we really enjoy the product when it ' s not spoiled .

I think these people need to give up hope in the kale chip business . The birds in the back yard wouldn ' t even eat these !</text>

		<text>I have tried several Dr . McDougall ' s Vegan soups with three different microwaves . The time needed in each has been quite different - from needing less ( to avoid boiling over ) to needing more . The soup should to be very hot but not hot enough to boil over . I believe many complaints of &quot; chewy &quot; pasta / noodles / veggies is probably from unwillingness to experiment with cooking and standing times .</text>

		<text>A year or so ago , I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten - free . Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says &quot; gluten - free &quot; on the packaging and contains wheat . I didn ' t want them to go to waste , so I ate one anyway . I became very sick . I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat . Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat / gluten .</text>

		<text>I didn ' t like this coffee at all . I like strong , full - flavored coffee and this is not it . There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak . So far the only K - cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast ( I think that ' s the brand )  but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save , so I always had coffee . I ordered the Tully ' s Italian Roast to see how it is , but it too isn ' t as good as the other .</text>

		<text>Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried , these by far are the best . They are close to the real thing as I recall . Sometimes they are difficult to obtain . Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten - intolerant . These are a must for me .</text>

		<text>I bought Halo because I was looking for a healthy way to help me transition my 3 cats from dry food to canned . My cats were kibble addicts , which the vet said was bad for them , and I wasn ' t having much luck trying to entice them to switch to canned food . I bought Halo chicken and I crumbled some over the canned food and my cats started gobbling it up . It is a little pricey but I like that it is purely dehydrated chicken with no additives .</text>

		<text>Planters Peanut Butter Cookie Crisps 100 Calorie Packs , 6 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) . These cookies are so tasty ! I love the peanut taste and the crispness . A one - hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them , but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on . Probably the most important part of weight control is portion control . The cookies have 3 grams fat , 0 mg Cholesterol , and 2 Weight Watchers points .</text>

		<text>Like the first reviewer , I too was surprised to get a box ( no inner box at all ) of loose k cups . There was a cardboard tube in the middle of the box to keep them from rolling around too much , but one was wrinkled so badly it almost fell apart . This is a nice assortment and you can compare different brands of the same flavors for your reference . But the package and presentation is low budget . Also no poster as described . Rating it a 4 for coffee assortment but a 0 for packaging and product misrepresentation !</text>

		<text>I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten - free diet . They taste great ! I had been getting them from my grocery store , but they are rather expensive , so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto - ship . These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them . I would highly recommend them .</text>

		<text>I love this coconut water - - it ' s naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water ( but not too much ) . My only &quot; complaint &quot; is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $ 22 - 23 on Amazon a few months ago , signing up for the regular delivery . Now , it is listed as &quot; not available &quot; for the regular delivery , but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $ 38 ( also a 12 - pack , same brand , same size per can ) . It ' s a bit unfair to lure in innocent people and then as soon as you get addicted to this fantastic coconut water ( and I count myself there ! ) you suffer some serious sticker shock .</text>

		<text>This is my favorite of all the Sparkling Ice flavors . Please see my complete review of it beside the 32 - ounce bottle , where I accidentally posted it . I ' d definitely stay with the 17 - ounce size because it ' s fun to drink out of that perfectly shaped bottle , and I wouldn ' t want to dilute the delicious , authentic flavor with ice . Since I posted that review my husband and I , in fear of running out of the stuff without access to it locally , have begun to receive the Pink Grapefruit , Orange Mango , and Black Raspberry by subscription , twice a month , and the shipping cartons are starting to loom . Now the fear is that we ' re turning into some sort of crazy soda cultists . I think we need an intervention .</text>

		<text>Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better . Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2 % milk is required even to get a child to drink them . My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best . Avoid if possible , but not a total waste . Consider my 2 stars as &quot; generous . &quot;</text>

Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet . it has great disease fighting properties and cleansing , so those that see the 872 calories and flip out , don ' t worry , because it is all good for you .

		<text>We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today . I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature ( I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6 - 9 seconds ) and taste ok . When I tasted this , I made a face because it was so yucky ! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon . To her credit , my ( 8 month old ) daughter ate some bites , but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors .

However , within seconds ( it was not even dry yet ) the squirrels were back and it had absolutely no effect on them . We stood and watched as 3 squirrels descended up on the bird feeder and began eating , soon even more squirrels arrived and stood on the top of the feeder what was still glistening with the product . We sprayed the surrounding area as well as the feeder itself until wet and dripping and it had absolutely no effect on both the adult and baby squirrels . don ' t waste your time .</text>

The capsule pill pockets are so large , you can easily split them in in half ( even if you ' re trying to hide capsule - sized pills ) . If you have tablet pills , I ' d bet you could use one capsule - size pill pocket for every 3 - 4 pills . I will not waste money again on the tablet version of this product !

		<text>I have been dissapointed at the store recently with my Top Sirloins . I am not even sure what meat group they are selling . Anyway gang you can never go wrong with Omaha . Delivery is fast and you receive them in a little igloo type thing with dry ice inside . The steaks are wonderful and I will definitely purchase more when I see the sale I like .

		<text>I ' ve tried a lot of meatless products out there and this sloppy joe mix is by far my favorite vegetarian meat alternative out there . EASY to make and we easily made seven good size sandwiches out of one box . Even if a person isn ' t vegetarian , the cost savings alone ( versus ground beef ) makes it worth it . Yum ! ! !</text>

		<text>I brought them for my trip to Europe . The hotels in Europe usually have a kettle , but only instant coffee power . It was wonderful to be able to have a real cup of coffee in my room ! It ' s also organic . I would prefer it to be a bit stronger , but over all this is a great product for traveling and camping . I ' ll definitely buy them again .</text>

		<text>I have ordered this stuff numerous times now and I haven ' t been disappointed . It is a bit on the pricey side , but I try not to use it all the time . The consistency is a bit less viscous and sticky than normal peanut butter due to the lack of oil I suppose . A great buy for those who want natural peanut butter flavor without all the calories and fat .</text>

		<text>This stuff tastes like mushrooms to me and I hate mushrooms ( partially allergic ) . I assume it ' s the soy based product coming out in it since it ' s vegan and doesn ' t use any other source of protein . I gave it an extra star ( bumped up from 1 star ) since it does provide protein and that ' s essentially what I wanted . I ended up returning it since it tastes horrible .</text>

		<text>This black licorice gum is so good ! As you chew it , it completely tastes of licorice , as if you are bitting into candy . Then , there is a cool icy mint flavor as well that gives your mouth full refreshment as you continue chewing the gum . It holds its flavor and elastisity and doesn ' t go bad after 10 minutes like some gum does . This gum gets five stars !</text>

		<text>My dogs just love these treats ! I break them up into a lot smaller pieces though since both dogs tend to gain weight if I give them whole treats . The smell heavenly and I ' m so glad they are dog treats because if they weren ' t , I ' d eat one every time I walked past the jar . They are pretty hard and can sometimes by tough to break up but it ' s seems a small effort when I see how much the dogs enjoy these .</text>

		<text>My husband had a bowl of steel cut oatmeal at a restaurant a short while ago and he came home raving about how different and good it was . We then decided to &quot; google &quot; steel cut oatmeal and then went to Amazon to see if it could be purchased , as we could not find it in any store . The McCANN ' S Steel Cut Irish oatmeal is just like the restaurant according to my husband , and he has been making it every morning for breakfast along with a bit of brown sugar . We will be giving a tin out to friends as a little Christmas present , too ! ! It is a great product and by the way , it makes great &quot; crunchy &quot; cookies as the texture is that way .</text>

		<text>Regardless as to how good or bad the food items are I don ' t consider this to be a ' gift box ' as a 4x7 inch non - removable shipping label was slapped on top of the box . As I was giving this to a friend for Christmas I attempted to remove the label . The holiday box design came up in strips along with the label . As one pays a premium for these food samples one does so because they are arranged and displayed attractively and come in a ' gift box ' to be given as gifts .</text>

Since its a new product , Starbucks take notice : the 50pc half - filled non - descript recycled box packaging it comes in is really lame ; It came crushed in the order . Moreover , the packets do not tear fully at the perforated line . Instead , try the VIA Colombia and VIA Mocha flavors .

		<text>We drink a lot of tea in our household - black , green , white and a variety of herbal . This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart ( where it sells for about $ 2 a box ; it sells for around $ 4 at our local grocery store . ) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh . We enjoy this tea with Splenda and sometimes with lemon for extra flavor . If microwaving your water , make sure it gets good and hot to get the most out of your teabag ; if the water isn ' t hot enough , the flavor is a little weak .</text>

It is very close to the Starbucks Italian roast . Sign up for a scheduled shipment on Amazon and get an even better price .</text>

		<text>I couldn ' t be happier with Wellness Core ! My dogs love it and I ' m happy that they are getting all the nutrients they need without all the added grains . I also had a tad of the Wellness food topper / mixer which they drool over ! The topper / mixer is also grain free . Gotta love it !</text>

		<text>I would recommend trying this flavor and this product in the store before buying . The planks are chewy enough that they taste kind of stale just as a granola bar or snack by themselves . I suppose if you were hiking and really hungry they might taste better , but I bought them for a snack when I work the midnight shift at work . They are acceptable with milk or yogurt , but I could just as easily buy regular granola and not have to break it up ( they don ' t break easily ) . I wouldn ' t buy this again .</text>

		<text>My Dad introduced me to this product . I was having lots of headaches and digestive issues when he suggested I try this drink . It ' s amazing what a little Mg can do ! I feel so much better and if I miss a day , my body let ' s me know as the previous symptoms reappear within 36 hrs of a missed dosage . I don ' t have the blaoting I used to either . this is so cool ! just throw a bowl in your pack and you ' ve got a great snack ! it smells soooo good ! gives a tuna fish sandwich a bad image . john</text>

		<text>I ' ve tried many green teas in the same price range , but I always come back to Stash Organic Green . This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste . It ' s light , vegetal and very smooth . To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas , and make sure the water temperature doesn ' t go over 180 degrees . I often mix this tea with cascade mint , jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it ' s very good by itself , plain green tea can get boring day - after - day . Contrary to the other reviewer , I don ' t like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder , and recommend this tea instead .</text>

		<text>I am a big fan of Cooking Light magazine . They regularly feature recipes using Israeli Couscous . I found it once at a local health food store , but it turned out that they had purchased it my mistake . I have driven 45 miles to the next biggest town to find it - even at specialty stores - and it is still pretty rare in these parts . I buy several bags from Amazon at a time and keep them stored in rugged plastic containers . They have one with cooked chicken and kalamatas that will knock your socks off .</text>

		<text>I previously bought a similar kind of trap in Europe , which was effective ( don ' t buy mole bait - that does not help ) , but I needed more to catch all moles in our garden . . This trap however does not compare to the easy one I had already . You don ' t just need force to set it ; you need an awful lot of it ! Ladies beware , using this trap is a man ' s job only ! ! ! On handling , beware to wear gloves , so you don ' t touch the trap with bare hands . Moles might be sensitive to that . .</text>

		<text>Unfortunately , I am stuck with 480 mints that I do not like because you cannot return these kind of items to Amazon ( which makes sense , I guess ) . Anyway , when you first put the mint in your mouth there is no taste . Zero . Then , as the mint gets crumbly - - not in a slow dissolve way but just a fall apart way - - you get a little mint . Maybe I got a bad batch , but whatever the case I certainly would not buy this brand again , and I learned not to buy items I ' ve never tried in such a large quantity .</text>

		<text>I like to try a lot of different coffee and have even roasted my own occasionally and this is by far one of the best if not THE best coffee I have had . The dark roast was very bold but yet very smooth , not bitter or burnt as some dark roasts taste . I realized how good it was this week when I ran out of the Hawaii Roasters Kona Dark Roast and went back to my supermarket &quot; premium &quot; whole bean coffee . I think I will be subscribing for the monthly delivery plan . I was also very impressed with the prompt delivery , I had my coffee 2 days after ordering it .</text>

		<text>I have been a long time lover of black licorice and dark chocolate . But since recently discovering RJs , I would have to say , if given a choice between a piece of the best dark chocolate and a piece of this licorice , hands down I ' d be going for the latter . I was astonishly surprised with my first bite - wonderfully soft and intensely flavorful . I enjoyed the fact that it didn ' t stick to me teeth or make me feel that I was having to give my mouth a workout to enjoy it . Amazon offers this at a great price too . I ' ve paid considerably more .</text>

		<text>I think this is a great product for the picky 2 - year old eater ( obviously younger children who are not ready for solid foods would also really benefit from this product . It can be sucked directly from the pouch or squeezed onto a spoon for feeding ) . My son ( the aforementioned picky eater ) eats fruits but no veggies , so I thought these pouches would be a good alternative to supplement his diet . He considers them a &quot; treat &quot; and gobbles them up . They are also a great traveling food - - perfect to pop in my purse when we are heading out . I love that they are organic , convenient and don ' t need to be refrigerated ( unless you open it ) .</text>

		<text>My husband and I travel for several weeks a year in an RV , and always take &quot; instant &quot; and &quot; single cup &quot; brews along with us . I have taken both Maxwell House and Folgers &quot; brew in the cup &quot; coffee bags , and found them acceptable ( in lieu of a fresh cup of coffee from an actual coffee pot ) , so my expectations were that this coffee would be similar in taste and quality . I was wrong . I thought this was an exceptionally tasty cup of coffee - on par with coffee that has been brewed in a coffee maker . It is smooth and flavorful , with a very fresh taste . I highly recommend it for those who want a good cup of coffee without committing to a whole pot - or to lugging a K - cup type brewer along to work or on the road .</text>

		<text>I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs . This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues . My Schipperke ' s are doing very well on this formula and no longer require Phenabarb or any seizure medication and the liver studies on their blood work are almost normal at 13 years of age after serious liver problems 8 years ago . Wellness tests All batches for problems prior to distribution . They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination .

		<text>The O ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow . This makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out . I just lift the top up a little when I poor to bypass this problem . The glass is sturdy and the apparatus that holds it is sturdy . I got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass , which looked terrible , but is easily disassembled to clean .

		<text>Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not &quot; open and serve soups &quot; nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end . So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed . As you can tell , I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand - - perfect for a northeast winter ' s day !</text>

		<text>If you ' re looking for the tea served on ice with condensed milk or hot at your favorite Thai restaurant , this is it ! The package says to use 4 tablespoons of tea per cup and strain - so I bought this 4 - pack ( figuring that 4T per cup would use up the stuff pretty fast ) . I think that ratio is way too much . I use about 3 tablespoons in my 1 liter French press , and it comes out great . Just pour the water over the tea , stir a few times while letting it steep and serve . Enjoy ! - Charlie</text>

		<text>This rice is a nice change from the traditional white rice I find in the local grocery , primarily because it ' s sticky . When reheated it tastes as good as it did when first prepared . I find that both white and brown rice becomes hard after sitting in the fridge overnight and I end up throwing the leftovers away , but this rice is simply not the same . It still seems freshly cooked 3 days later .</text>

		<text>My whole family gobbles this up - do not be afraid to cook longer than the box says to get the noodles nice and tender . Then I always pour the cooked noodles into a strainer in the sink and rinse all the &quot; sludge &quot; ( from the brown rice ) with cold water . Then I warm it back up in the pan , usally adding some sour cream , butter , &amp; salt / pepper to the sauce mix . As a former lover of all things gluten - containing , I have to say that when the rice pasta is rinsed , I think it ' s just as good if not better than traditional wheat pasta . Shocking &quot; the pasta with cold water makes all the difference in the world ! Hope this helps .</text>

		<text>WONDERFUL TEA ! Much better than their tea bags . This is a MUST HAVE in our home as we both enjoy a cuppa to start and end most days . We were using the actual tea bags for years . We didn ' t think that we ' d change as it was so inexpensive as we each reused a tea bag for our days cuppa . While using the K - cups is not as cost effective , IT CERTAINLY DOES MAKE EACH CUP A PERFECT EXPERIENCE ! ! ! !</text>

In the days of the two dollar soda , it is nice to know there is a cost effective alternative . Just one of these yields many servings . So thankful to whomever invented this concept .</text>

		<text>The salt liocorice was very good . It came nice and moist , so even our three year old could chew it up . It brought back memories for my husband , whom ate it while he was a little kid . My only complaint if you want to call it that was that it could have been a little bit saltier . I know I could have ordered double zout , but this for single salt should have been slightly saltier . Enjoy !</text>

		<text>Torani Sugar Free Raspberry Syrup is a great tasting , diabetic friendly flavoring . This syrup has a subtle and natural raspberry flavor that goes great in ice tea or mixed with club soda . The Splenda sweetener gives this just the right amount of sweetness , without the unpleasant aftertaste or gastric distress that other artificial sweeteners can cause . Highly Recommended !

		<text>One of my kitties has ear allergies , so after much research I decided to put them on a grain free diet . I purchased a number of different types of can food from the pet store . They rejected a majority of it and refused to eat it . They went nuts over this canned food , so I am now a huge fan . My pet store does not keep much in stock , so I was thrilled to find it on amazon !</text>

I also like the coconut fudge ( i think that ' s the flavor ) because it tastes like the girl scout samoas ( or caramel delites depending on region ) . Such a great snack .

		<text>I won ' t bore you with stats about salt , the good bad or ugly . Yes , you are supposed to take it in moderation , so when you do salt your food , it should be done with this salt . It is a really high quality pure , and tasty treat . It offers a little more distinction that your Kosher Sea Salt , which is a bland NaCL . This is chock full of trace minerals that your body needs . Bottom line : good product .</text>

The item is a tasty treat for yourself during the day , with the sweetness of the chocolate along with the bitterness of the coffee bean is an amazing combination , and you will be nicely energized for the rest of the day . The sellers themselves are amazingly helpful and very quick to respond to any problems you may be having , I highly recommend this product from this seller . 10 / 10</text>

Gluten is the heart of breads and pastas , so , doing without it , never gives exactly the same taste and texture . However , this is hands down the best gluten - free bread that I ' ve eaten . It is good enough that my wife and kids actually love eating it . They say that , while it is a little different than regular bread , they very much like it . Still , we buy ours at Whole Foods for $ 5 / 12oz - loaf .</text>

		<text>In researching dandelion root , I came across a lot of different , sometimes contradictory claims , none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research . I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect , and it is supposedly good for the liver . Again , those claims may be dubious , but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason ( caffeine , acid ) . It tasted terrible to me at first , but after about 4 cups I really started to like it . I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes . Now it basically tastes like coffee to me ( note that I ' m more of a tea drinker , however ) .</text>

Lipton ' s Blackberry Vanilla Tea , in its distinctive pyramid shape , allows the full essence of both flavours to circulate and infuse into a truly enjoyable tea experience .

		<text>As the reviewer above stated this is not for two 12 packs . Rather this is for one 12 pack with 6 of each variety . What a rip off . Amazon , this is a major deal breaker . If I could find a 1800 number I would have called and went beserker , but there is not one . This would have been a - 1 if possible .</text>

		<text>. . but the product photo threw me off a little . For some reason I was thinking the 3 pounds were being shipped in ( 6 ) 1 / 2 pound bags . Anyway , totally an assumption and goof - up on my part . I ' m leaning towards using all liquid malt extract going forward though . I can get 6 pounds ( just the right amount for a 5 - 6 gallon batch ) shipped to my house for about $ 16 . The dry malt has extended shelf life , and has more malt per pound , but in terms of ease of use and economy the liquid malt seems like the way to go .</text>

		<text>It ' s hard to explain what this Bonito del Norte tuna is like to people that can only relate to the canned tuna commonly found in grocery stores in America . It really is a completely different type of food . Delicate , tasteful , and healthy ! You are probably used to mixing your tuna with mayonnaise or some other thing to make it palatable , but it would be a shame to do that with this tuna , because it is truly a pleasure to eat on its own on crispy french bread . I will keep ordering this product and make it a regular part of my diet .</text>

		<text>Kashi makes some fine things , but this &quot; 7 Grain Whole Pilaf &quot; is in my opion their best . It is very versatile and easy to prepare , and can even be cooked in a rice cooker . It ' s great plain as a hot cereal , makes a wonderful pilaf , and a delicious salad . It also makes a great base for vegetable patties or loaf . Just about any dish using a grain base works well . I could make a different dish everyday with it and never tire of it !</text>

		<text>I tried out these treat sticks for my dog and she quite liked them . They are somewhat chewer and take longer to get through that similar chew sticks so they keep the little beast occupied a bit longer . And if the packaging can be believed , they are healthier than other chew sticks too . I will likely buy her some more of these .</text>

		<text>I was originally purchasing this at Petfood Express in San Francisco . Then I saw it was cheaper at Amazon and started buying from there . The food that came from Amazon was lighter in color and had more dusty / small particles of food throughout . The food is currently back - ordered at Amazon . So I purchased it from the store again , and noticed the difference again . Has anyone else noticed the product varies depending on where it is purchased ?</text>

		<text>I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market . They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products . So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away . Not only that , the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market . By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it .</text>

		<text>When I bought this popcorn , it was because Amazon recommended it or at least showed it with the air popper . As other reviewers have said , this popcorn does not work in the air popper . It hasn ' t got enough weight to stay in the popper long enough to pop . That same quality - lightness - is actually what makes it good popcorn otherwise . I recommend it for stove top popping in a deep saucepan with a lid .</text>

		<text>I started getting the Crisp Bread from Amazon was I could not find it anywhere in this area . Never thought of it as a health food , but one day found it in a health food store . the size was shrunk over the years but it is still a great rye cracker . Oh , it is cheaper from Amazon than the local health food store . i ' ve always loved panda licorice , but only just forayed out of the original flavor . so glad i did . prefer this a little over the raspberry , but i still love the raspberry too . Love these resealable bags , since Pandas do tend to dry out . this is the problem i find with the boxes , even after you close them properly .</text>

		<text>The aroma was amazing but it just tasted like regular coffee . The coffee was good , it just did not have the flavor I was expecting . Also this was a present for my dad and the way it was packaged the bag got two holes in it . Luckily only a small amount of coffee grounds were lost and I was able to patch the bag with tape . Although my dad felt obligated to use this coffee up as quickly as possible because he was worried the holes would effect how long it stayed fresh which is not how I would want him to feel about his present .</text>

		<text>Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors . I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily .</text>

		<text>These blueberries are a nice size and nice texture . I like them better in that regard than the ones I have been buying from Trader Joe ' s . They are a little on the sweet side ( note I don ' t use sugar so most things are too sweet for me ) . These bags sell at Costco for $ [ . . . ] .</text>

		<text>This beef jerky is extremely salty . I tried the wood smoked flavor , and I figured people were just being a bit picky . However , it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much . The container says 570mg sodium or 24 % of daily value for one serving . I would recommend trying a different product .</text>

		<text>I purchased these chips since they are so much cheaper than what they cost on the grocery . they did not expire for about 2 months , but the first 2 or 3 bags we ate were stale , plus many were broken up . I wrote amazon and they did give me a prompt refund , so their customer service is excellent . we have since opened some more bags and they do not seem as stale , but I still do not believe they taste as fresh as the ones from grocery . I may try reordering these since they are such a good deal and hopefully can give a better review the next time .</text>

		<text>I cannot say I had high expectations for a low - acid French roast coffee . It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full - bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee . It is not bad an certainly an alternative if you are susceptible to acid but it is not in competition for any premium coffee awards .</text>

		<text>The cure taste is too strong . The instructions they have can ' t be correct . I ' ve only tried it with cut meat , no ground . I let it marinade for about a day and a half . Next time I ' m either going to wash the marinade before I dry it or use ground beef and a jerky gun . The flavor is alright but definitely not better than something almost anyone could make themselves .</text>

		<text>This was my first wine kit , it was easy to understand and easy to use . I am about one more week from completing it so I cannot yet comment on the taste . I have to admit before I bought this kit  i didn ' t realize you also need to purchase all of the necessary wine making equipment . I really like the fact that the kit includes all the ingredients for the wine in addition to the corks , labels , and sleeves for the bottle necks so that the finished product looks very professional and can be given as gifts , some of the more expensive wine kits from other manufacturers do not include those extra items .</text>

		<text>I ' m a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the &quot; bold &quot; flavors . The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second . I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor . Its a nice balance . I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom .</text>

		<text>If there is a negative statement to be made it would be that this product makes only one cup at a time . I enjoy my coffee and found that this brand lives up to its description . Besides the flavor , this brand goes the proverbial extra mile in being earth friendly . The packet describes the treatment of the workers and plants as well as states that part of the proceeds go to an organization started by this brand - - - Kicks For Causes - - which assists in the development of youth soccer programs . As stated on the package &quot; the proper place for a child is on the playground , not in the workplace &quot; . A statement we as consumers need to be more mindful about !</text>

The last time I bought a box of Spanish rice , I tossed the seasoning pack and added a couple of tablespoons of this instead . It was just as good and the only salt came from the canned tomatoes . Pretty good as taco meat seasoning , also . I highly recommend it for anyone , especially those who love Tex - Mex and are watching the salt a bit .</text>

		<text>Decent , strong cup with overtones of Italian or French roasts . CP Organic Bold is a bit &quot; rounder &quot; and Jet Fuel is a tad bitter . Produces a nice cup of reasonably strong coffee that is not bitter or harsh . Our prefs run to CP Organic and Green Mountain Dark Magic or Double Black Diamond and the occasional Italian or French Roast . We find the Timothy ' s blends to be rather bitter . With the bulk packaging and subscription , Coffee People produce the least expensive K cups we have found at around 35 cents per pod .</text>

		<text>I really liked the taste of this drink - it reminded me of a cherry soda . There was no aftertaste and it did seem to give me more energy to get through the part of the day that just drags on . I also thought it worked fairly quickly . I was a bit surprised to discover that each can actually contains 2 servings , at approximately 130 calories each , so it ' s definitely not a diet - friendly drink . Although I think the drink did provide more of a boost than a diet soda , for me , it ' s just not worth the extra calories on a regular basis . That said , I would drink it again and I would recommend the drink to people who are looking for energy drinks or don ' t mind the calories ( and sugar ) .</text>

		<text>If I had one wish , it would be that Crystal Light On the Go came in a variety pack so I can decide which flavors I like without buying an entire case . The Raspberry Lemonade flavor is OK and I ' ll drink it  but I think the flavor is too tart . Maybe I ' ll try the Fruit Punch next .</text>

		<text>If only the jar inside were not plastic , which makes me nervous , especially with boiling water potentially leaching toxic compounds . But a quart glass jar will break from the shock of the difference between the cold contents and boiling water . If you try to use warm water to prevent the glass from breaking , warm , 95 F water added to the starter causes it to gel into lumps . This will help prevent the jar from breaking , and the yogurt turns out okay , but after that , when you transfer a quarter cup for the next batch and add milk , you ' d better not heat the milk up too hot , keep an eye on it . One of the reasons I bought this yogurt maker was that it was less of a hassle and used less energy , but the workaround to avoid the plastic container is a bit annoying . Wish they made a metal jar , if that ' s possible . . .</text>

		<text>These bones are my dog ' s absolute favorite . He is a SUPER strong chewer , although he only weighs about 60 lbs and is otherwise completely gentle . It ' s sometimes hard to find bones and toys for him since he always chews them to bits within 5 minutes . These bones last him forever , at least 3 - 4 months at a time . He loves the filling and will lick it for hours . Would recommend these bones to any large dog owner .</text>

		<text>These little bars are quite delicious and healthy . I originally bought these at Costco but saw these on sale one day on amazon so I decided to give them a shot . The bars that they sell at Costco are a bit larger 220 calories than these ones at 170 calories . I ordered 4 boxes and none of mine have been stale like some other reviewers have complained about . Worth the money .</text>

		<text>I agree with Cavalier , having bought 2 - 3 orders in Dec . 2009 , all of which were burnt . Before that there hadn ' t been a problem . I checked in here to see if I could tell the problem had been solved , but Cavalier wrote in March 2010 his were burnt , so I ' m not ordering again , at least for now . I must say , however , that I contacted Amazon about the problem as being defective , and they refunded all right away . I have never had a problem with Amazon customer service , and may have been their first customer back when they first started .</text>

		<text>A bit hard to get from the container into your spray bottle without spilling a bit or getting it on yourself ( comes out as a very thick gooey gel )  but once it ' s mixed with water and shaken up a bit it ' s fine . One thing I noticed is that after applying there is a fine powdery dust leftover on the leaves . I guess this is normal for a combo product such as this since this also has a miticide and fungicide , but if you buy standalone insecticidal soaps you don ' t typically see this . Either way it gets the job done , kills mites and other annoying insects fast , and has the added benefit that if you ' re using it on edible plants you can eat them right away !</text>

		<text>This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily - - good if you ' re into that . It ' s also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you ' ve eaten a piece ( or two , or however many you ' re going to munch on at that instance ) . If you ' re sensitive to spicy food , this probably isn ' t for you . Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12 &quot; pizzas ( one if you really want to pile on the toppings ) .</text>

No bitterness to it and the smell in the house when it was brewing was as if you were in a Caribou coffee estanlishment .

		<text>I have been drinking Essentia for about a month now and really feel it makes a difference in my hydration . I can tell that more now that I ran out and had to supplement my Amazon purchase with running to the store . I know a couple of reviewers have said it doesn ' t seem to taste different but I would beg to differ . I use a Brita filter on both my faucet and through a pitcher and can tell the Essentia water has a smoother texture &quot; feel &quot; than the filtered water .

		<text>This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely . When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha , I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves . It wasn ' t unpleasant , just totally unexpected . The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste , where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor . The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor , and I can ' t help but wonder if the spiciness isn ' t at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground . Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink !</text>

		<text>I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty . If you use the recommended 8oz setting , it has a full enough flavor . My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener . It leaves that horrible chemical aftertaste that diet sodas do . If you don ' t have a problem with Splenda and you like spiced chai , this is the K - cup for you ! If you are like me though , and have an aversion to artificial sweeteners , it looks like we are still stuck with brewing the tea ( such as Celestial ' s India Spice Chai ) and adding our own milk and sugar .</text>

It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea . I think another reviewer who described it as a &quot; burnt &quot; flavor may have gotten it right . I tried it once , and immediately switched back to Twinings . I recently tried a second bag , thinking maybe I overreacted the first time , but had to pour it away .</text>

		<text>My son is very picky . Once he saw these pouches in target and grabbed one and asked me to open it . he then devoured the entire pouch in less than 5 min . So i decided to buy him this from amazon . He enjoys one almost everyday for a snak . you know how when you bite into a nice piece of tasty fruit licorice ? that exquisite moment when the citrus hits the taste buds and you know that the soft chew soon to follow will release more flavor ? that ' s what you ' ll get with this pomegranate licorice ! thank heavens that Amazon only sent a small bag , ' cause there is no way a big stash would last very long in the casa ! this is some good stuff !</text>

		<text>This is my new favorite K - Cup . For anyone who has had the Blueberry coffee at Quick Check ( convenience store ) , this tastes just like it . It is slightly bitter and slightly strong with a lot of blueberry flavor . The flavor does resemble that of a blueberry muffin more than of an actual blueberry . I would also reccomend trying it with vanilla creamer .</text>

		<text>So Fall is the time for all the cliches we see advertising autumn leaves , Halloween , Thanksgiving , and pumpkins everywhere . How appropriate a time to try this new blend . and I must say , I love the flavor of pumpkin , so I was genuinely looking forward to this . Be warned , it does say pumpkin spice Latte , so when the cup produces a foam , it was designed to do that . Flavor is good , not great , but it is creamy , sweet and smells heavenly so not too much to complain about . Very little coffee flavor , but a nice cup of fall flavor .</text>

		<text>These lollipops are great ! Each one was made of beautiful rainbow colors and they weren ' t messy looking . I liked the fact that the plastic did NOT have writing on it ( I hate that ) . They are small ( around 3 &quot; I believe ) but perfect for a candy buffet for a kids birthday party ( which is what I used them for ) . Great deal for 38 of them !</text>

		<text>I guess I had no idea how good the goji berries were from Whole Foods until I tried these . They are not horrible , and I guess if you had nothing to compare them with they might be fine , but I found them to be dry and bitter compared to the ones I get at Berkeley Whole Foods . I worry about &quot; organic &quot; products from China too . Who verifies that a food product is truly organic and safe anyway ? I wish I could invent a food tester to check for poisons like lead and melamine .</text>

		<text>When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts ! It is really wonderful and my go - to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve ( sometimes several as I give them away ) .</text>

		<text>After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it , I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come . Unfortunately for me , the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly . But I stuck with it , started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production . While I ' m sure it works for some , if you ' re just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with I don ' t think taking this will increase your supply much if at all . But if you think you ' d like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you !</text>

		<text>I am from Asian descent and we regularly use coconut oil for everything . My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat , hand pressing the liquids , then boil the water out . This oil tastes and smells just like the kind my Mother used to spend hours making . This is definitely worth the price for the amount of oil that you get . I use this as a hair detangler out of the shower , as make - up remover , face and body moisturizer , and lip balm . I also use it for cooking and as a dietary supplement .</text>

		<text>This was an enjoyable and refreshing treat on a hot summer day . I poured the coffee over ice to enjoy it colder and it was very good . It has a strong , bold coffee flavor , not bitter , and is slightly sweetened but not very sweet . You could always add more sweetener to suit your taste , but I personally didn ' t find it necessary . At only 50 calories a can this is a nice light drink .</text>

		<text>We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer . It is not as good as A &amp; W root beer but it makes a great root beer float . It does not taste overly sweet , nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste . Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit . I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float !</text>

		<text>I ' m not familiar with the benefits of high pH water like this but if it ' s better for you than normal water then I ' d highly recommend this product because it tastes EXACTLY like regular filtered , bottled water . Some people have talked about different aftertastes or flavors but to me it tastes the same as other bottled waters , even when drunk back to back . If this is healthier than just drinking water it ' s a great option - no calories , no added ingredients to give flavor , etc . Basically just water with hidden health benefits .</text>

		<text>I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet . It ' s soft enough to roll out or shape for making fruits or other decorations , but still holds its shape as it dries out . It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months . The 7 oz . tube is fairly small and I wish they made a larger size , but the multipack is a nice option for this reason . I ' ll be buying this brand again .</text>

		<text>Other than pricing for the coffee which is all over the map ( anywhere from $ . 40 per cup to $ . 75 ) the coffee itself is excellent . . Just have to look around for the deals every two to four weeks , depending on how much I can buy at once . . . the only negative is I like big cups of coffee - 10 to 12 ounce cups - and there are very few blends or brands that sell cartridges designed to brew these larger sizes so I end up using two coffee cartridges to brew one cup of coffee . it gets expensive and I haven ' t perfected using the generic cartridge to brew the perfect cup of coffee like the disposable cartridges produce . . .</text>

Yes it wasn ' t FULLY melted when I got them , but the whole thing looks like its been stored somewhere in the desert in Nevada for three days before shipped to me . Yes it came with an ice pack that was supposed to keep it cool , except that the ice pack itself is like a balloon filled with warm water .

They are still good for me , however , so I will continue to eat them until the bag is finished . It was my own naivety that lead me to believe I would enjoy eating them . This should not deter anyone who really wants to benefit from all their healthy goodness .</text>

		<text>My cats love this food and one of them doesn ' t usually touch canned food . I know that canned food is much better for them and I feel better that this product does not include unhealthy grains . There is a lot of juice in this , but the picky cat really likes to lick up the juice . I haven ' t seen any problems with vomiting since I switched them to this .</text>

		<text>I am torn : 4 stars or 5 stars ? I decided on 5 stars : - The taste is great ! If you are Coke or Pepsi drinker , then they may not be sweet enough for you . I am not , hence I and my entire family enjoyed their subtle chocolaty flavor . The nutritional content is not bad at all , except artificial flavoring , which I would never notice on my taste buds if it was not written . All - in - all - - absolutely delicious and filling snack !</text>

		<text>I had these cookies in Germany , but I had a hard time finding them in the US . I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon . They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies , but they ' re a little richer and a little moister . I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12 , but I already knew I liked them , so ordering 12 wasn ' t really a problem . A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately .</text>

		<text>I bought this item because I wanted a treat that would last a little longer and keep my dogs attention . I use this treat with this toy as a special occasion treat and my dog loves it every time . My dog even likes the toy by itself and will gnaw on it for awhile . My only complaint is that he is able to bite off small ( pea - sized ) chunks from the white plastic bone . Once that happens , I find myself replacing the toy because you do not want to step on the toy by accident because the white part becomes very sharp . I am on my second replacement in two years .</text>

		<text>I started drinking Goji juice a few months ago , per the request of an acupuncturist , and ever since I tried it , I ' ve been hooked . Supposedly it ' s a &quot; blood builder , &quot; but don ' t expect super fast results for that function . While it might kick in eventually , it does take awhile , but the overall nutritive qualities of this food are near close to being unparalleled : it is a super food and anyone looking for an ULTRA healthy pick - me - up would do good to try this out . It is chock full of Amino Acids and many vital minerals and is deeply fortifying . It also adds a nice dose of Vitamin C , which is helpful in the cold and flu season . Drink to good health !</text>

		<text>Bought this at Ralphs , 1 for $ 4 . 49 to try and was unimpressed . The high protein is great , but you can find that in other grocery store products . The high fiber is great for diets , and you can ' t find this high in any other pasta , but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids . It definitely tastes and feels better than some &quot; healthy &quot; pastas available , but I ' m just not sold on this . If you want low net carbs and that ' s your main goal , definitely use this and add in meats , veggies , and cheese to your dish for a good meal .</text>

		<text>Great real coconut young coconut taste . Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks . Good on the environment . Made in Brazil . Even better . You can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste</text>

		<text>100 % Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers . This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes . The pods work well , as intended , and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity . The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use . I have since tried several of their different coffees , and yet this remains my favorite ! litly carbonated yet sweet not to sweet it does really taste like lime and it is a very good soda i love limes and 7up and ramune a japenese soda . if you like any of those u will love this stuff but dont buy it on amazon buy it at smith which sels them for 89 . c you have to use a bottle opener to open them enjoy</text>

		<text>I experienced the same disappointment that multiple reviewers have . The hose and bottle consistently separate from each other . Varying the water pressure didn ' t help much either . It blew apart a half dozen times in a row , spraying my face with definitely water and possibly the poison ( if it was even mixing ) . I am extremely disappointed and can not believe this product is still on the shelves . I can not voice my displeasure enough .</text>

It ' s yummy , comes in smaller boxes ( portion control anyone ? ! ) and you can ' t beat this price on Amazon .

		<text>Its really pretty good ! I found this is a pretty handy addition to many menu items , and a great alternative to basic taco sauce or salsa all the time . I like it best as a sauce for nachos and tacos , as it can stand up to heavier ingredients like beans and ground beef . I was a little concerned it would taste really artificial , but think it really is a good thing to have around the house actually . Its got a spicy yet well balanced flavor . I found it tastes especially good stirred in with a little sour cream to add lightness , and think it tasted really good with chicken .</text>

		<text>Brilliant way to indulge in the flavor of chocolate without having to think about sugar or gluten or anything else you might be trying to avoid . Last year I drank this yummy organic tea while on a detox plan and it was very satisfying and felt decadent . It smells like hot chocolate or , as my son says , brownies , lending a soothing aroma - therapeutic effect as well . The tea contains nutrients such as Vitamin D , potassium , and magnesium , antioxidants and Theobromine which boost energy and mood .</text>

		<text>Like others , I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it . I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine , my dog LOVED them like always ! When I went to re - order , I read the review about the treats now being &quot; basted &quot; with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird , because my order was the same . That is , until I received this last order of 4 packs this week . All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor - - my dog , who was usually so excited to get one of these treats , left it on the floor untouched . We are both VERY disappointed - - not at Amazon , but at the manufacturer for changing their product</text>

		<text>To start with , I ' m not a big fan of hot tea . I like iced tea , but I prefer to drink coffee if I ' m having a hot beverage . That said , I was pleasantly surprised with this tea . It has a good , smooth taste to it . To me , the taste is not overwhelming or bitter , and it is smooth and strong enough that I didn ' t feel compelled to add any sweetener . I would fail miserably if I tried to describe the taste to anyone else , but I can say that I quite enjoy it and will probably pick up some more now that the weather is starting to cool off .</text>

		<text>I was hesitant to start mixing flavors so soon , but ran out of regular food while on family vacation recently . My husband grabbed this for our baby ( 7 months old ) and I thought , oh great - this is going to suck . Well , it didn ' t - the baby gobbled this up the first time and every time we feed him this flavor . Even though I try to do all organic , this is one I happily make an exception for because he loves it so much . I appreciate that Gerber really is making the effort to provide healthy , good quality , affordable options for baby ' s developing palates .</text>

		<text>Mostly , this was good stuff . I haven ' t had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some . Most of the jerky was good , but I ran into 1 too many pieces that was fatty or felt like a salty chunk of fat . I wish I would ' ve gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff , but it is good . They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff , or I might have to go to a different brand .</text>

		<text>Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies , some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags . The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent / normal size but they really are a bit smaller . Case they are shipped in is great for storage , in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase . Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though . . . unless you like dark , crumby hard ones .</text>

		<text>The best choclate I have tasted . Beats Cadbury , Hershey , Giradelli and more . Not only that but this brand has a number of different very funny labels . Check them at this link [ . . . ] You will see they have a real sense of humor at the same time as making great chocolate .</text>

		<text>This product is excellent for making homemade soy hot cocoa mix ( a few family members are allergic to dairy ) - we have not used this on its own . This mix is not easy to find in local grocery stores and Amazon made it a breeze to order and ship . BTW , the hot cocoa mix turned out great ; make sure to use a good - quality baking cocoa ( like Guittard ) . We followed Alton Brown ' s recipe ( ) without the cayenne ( for the kids ) . On a cold , blustery day , no one gets left out on the fun when they get asked , &quot; Who wants hot cocoa ? &quot;</text>

		<text>I bought this item in ' Mocha ' flavor and it is YUMMYYY ! It replaces my daily morning coffee and it especially good after a workout . I find it quite strong ( for me ) , so sometimes I mix it with another protein powder for less caffeine and more protein ( a scoop of this one has 15g protein ) . I ' ll be buying it over and over , it tastes delicious and doesn ' t have that weird protein taste some powders have . It ' s amazing , even if it clumps a little when I don ' t use the blender and mix it with milk . Expensive for me since I am in Canada , but totally worth it !</text>

		<text>There is no finer chocolate in all the world , in my opinion . After I went vegan , I found myself pining for chocolate . Like an idiot , I tried the only thing I could find in the stores , Baker ' s . Then I discovered Lindt . . . The thing is , even though this is technically &quot; dark &quot; or &quot; non - milk &quot; chocolate , it tastes like the most divine of milk chocolates . Truly , truly worth the price !</text>

		<text>I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely . The juice has a nice , robust texture , and it is not overly salty . The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing . I combine it with Odwalla flash - pasteurized 100 % carrot juice for a well - above - average vegetable juice that is a good energy - booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices . Enjoy !</text>

		<text>My family loves Popcorners and the kettle variety has become our favorite movie snack . We think it tastes even better than actual kettle corn . The serving sizes are fairly small so one bag doesn ' t go far . At only 100 calories per serving it is a great , healthy snack . These have become a staple in our gluten free household .</text>

		<text>I use a ton of &quot; greenies &quot; or other dental products for my little dog ( a 7 lb Yorkie / Maltese mix . ) She used to hate it when I left the house , so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only . However , she was started to get a little chunky , so thought switching her to the &quot; light &quot; version might be a better option . I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system , but I ' ve seen no problem thus far , and I ' ve been using them for over a week . She doesn ' t seem to notice a difference at all , and I feel comfortable knowing I ' m not overfeeding her ( in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place ! ) I would definitely recommend this product .</text>

		<text>I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink . To my taste buds , this does not taste rich and chocolate - y despite its name of &quot; Double Chocolate Meltdown &quot; . But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose , it is the best hot chocolate powder around . I ' ve tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee . It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee , and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation . Love it for that !</text>

		<text>Great tasting organic product ! I have been on a somewhat organic diet since I was a child . My parents always had an organic garden and now I have one . My son also loves organic food and this was a great alterative to regular store brands . Adding organic sour cream or extra cheese to it just enhances the taste . Amazon is a great way to purchase this product if you do not have a Fresh Market or a health food store in your area .</text>

		<text>We have a self - cleaning litter box that by theory is great , but once the surfaces are scratched , they don ' t perform very well . If you are careful to never scoop residue from the pans to keep them smooth , this system works beatifully . I like that I always have an opportunity to clean one tray while the other one is in use , letting it dry thoroughly before putting it back into use . Sifting can be messy , but developing a little technique can minimize that . Will definitely repurchase one of these when replacing this one .</text>

It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings .

If you ' re looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste , then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea , Tazo , will disappoint you . The raw rooibos taste , without these &quot; improvements &quot; such as vanilla , is full - bodied and has its own unique taste . I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings , Republic of Tea , and Numi .</text>

		<text>Although it is a little on the pricey side , this product is good because it helps keep food waste clean in the recycling bin . So far there is no tear , it holds a great amount of food waste . I use only 1 bag a week to keep all my food waste . Odor seems to stay in too . I strongly recommend whoever that likes to recycle food waste to use this bag . It says on the box that you can even use it to store your vegetable in the fridge because it helps the vege to stay fresh .</text>

		<text>Great tasting fat free hot chocolate ! The packets don ' t have enough in them to make a great cup of hot chocolate , so this canister is perfect as you can put in the amount you want to make the taste perfect ! Stores here don ' t carry this canister anymore so thank you Amazon ! Wish was a bit cheaper though !</text>

With no calories and no carbs it has now replaced my diet coke as an everyday beverage . I have no problems with the tall 17 oz bottle .

		<text>I really love their other products but this one just isn ' t a winner . I tried every combination possible ( microwave , hot water , hot milk ) hoping that the favor would change , especially since I bought 8 boxes of the stuff . But no luck ! I can ' t seeing throwing the stuff away so I will donate it and hope that it bring someon ' s taste buds alive . i have enjoyed this product for quite some time . however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at $ 35 per case , customers are paying more than $ 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on . shame on nana and amazon . . .</text>

The bbq and cheese ones are my fav , but recently ordered the sweet potatoes and found them to be lacking in taste . In fact , they tasted just like all the other types of chips , lacking flavor .

I added chicken and stewed tomatoes for my first try the 6 suggested servings went to 3 second helping and the picky kids scraping the bowls asking for more . I am glad I put this on subscribe and save because I already have request for more . If your not big into spicy food only add half the seasoning packet but the other half is great to add to chili of beef stew even spaghetti sauce .</text>

		<text>I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe . Whenever I put it out at feeding time , there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot ' s Stew in them . With 5 kitty mouths to feed , the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot ' s Stew , so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied . Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting , those poor things that had to &quot; settle &quot; for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew . I have been so pleased with it , that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners . But , at our house , WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines !</text>

If you want to try it don ' t make the mistake I did and order the 16 - Ounce bag . package is easy to open . that is probably the best thing about these cookies . they taste more like wafers than cookies . the cookie is too thin and the p - nut butter flavor is too weak for my taste . i expected more from oreo .</text>

Perfectly balanced spices with a hint of heat from black pepper . Keep in mind it is a process to brew , so give yourself about 10 + minutes from start to finish . Use 1 3 / 4 teaspoons per serving and sweeten with honey to enhance the flavors .</text>

		<text>Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added .

If that many eggs are needed , I might as well make the cake from scratch . No need for a mix . As a side note , the cake mix did perform well and produce a good angel food cake .</text>

Being able to buy multiple boxes and get the free delivery is fantastic ! Thanks !</text>

		<text>I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts . These are just average quality , and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful . The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans . There are barely any pecans , but tons of cashews . Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there .</text>

		<text>Sometimes more is NOT better . In this instance , however , double the bergamot IS FAR superior to regular Earl Grey tea . Stash found a good balance and actually improved on what a basically good thing ( Earl Grey tea ) . If you have not tried this I highly recommend it . You will never look at tea the same again .</text>

He noted that this blend of agave had more nutritional value than the brand he buys at the grocery store . Nice to know something lives up to the hype : )</text>

		<text>I found this at Ocean State Job Lot too , for $ 3 . 99 . Just wondering why such a tasty tea would be at all the overstock and close out stores ? I think I ' ll pick up another 80 pack before it disappears from the shelves . Often my favorite Job Lot finds are a one time closeout and I can never find them again !</text>

		<text>These soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking . With 7 grams of protein in each serving , they are SO much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods . They have a great flavor , just enough salt , and leave you feeling satisfied - nutritionally and snackwise ! My grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking . I highly recommend them .</text>

		<text>This is by far the best GF sandwich bread I ' ve tried yet , Whole Foods makes a good one as well but for the price GF Pantry is much better . It actually tasted like white bread . It was moist and fluffy . Cut it thin because it is really filling . PS Pamelas GF bread mix was strange , very dense and tasted like bisquits , and Bobs Red Mill stinks of Garbanzo bean flour</text>

		<text>These are very good tasting and when I gave a few to my baby he loved them ! But after looking at the back and seeing that the second ingredient is sugar I decided this probably isn ' t the kind of thing I want my baby to get used to . I don ' t want him to get used to sugary snack foods at such a young age , I ' m sure there will be enough of that when he ' s older . I wish Happy Baby would come up with a yogurt snack with no or very little sugar , I would buy it than .</text>

		<text>This is an excellent , cost - effective alternative to Red Bull . The flavor is spot on - - even though a purist may be able to notice the difference , I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal ! For the price , two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this . Also , with this syrup , you have the option to how strong or weak you ' d like to make each serving . I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further . I think you would be hard - pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original .</text>

Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger ' s rear , and it brings back memories . Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma . Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens , and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy , who ' s in charge of snack purchases , bought these in bulk , which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office .</text>

		<text>The astronaut ice cream was broken up into not - too - small bite size chunks , melts in your mouth , and was fresh and delicious ! The expiration date was about 2 yrs ahead . At 120 calories and 6g of fat , this treat is pretty good for the calorie - conscious too ( ? ) Another reviewer commented that there were slits in the inner paper packaging and threw out the product - the slits are to facilitate the freeze drying process as mentioned on the wrapper . Bulk purchase keeps the price lower than at the museum . Plan to buy more when I eat this batch up !</text>

		<text>I have been eating these for years . They are fabulous ! Less crumbly and airy than rice cakes , plus fewer calories . Scrumptious with butter , the best cracker for tuna salad , and wonderful with peanut butter . Perfect for the gluten intolerant , which I am .</text>

		<text>This is the best Blueberry tea that I have ever had . I use 2 bags of blueberry plus 1 bag of green tea for a 16 oz cup of iced tea . So rich in flavor , even though the instructions seem to indicate that I should double the blueberry tea bags for iced tea . I sweeten it with Stevia drops . I received my first order today , and it is so good that I have just reordered . So much better than Celestial blueberry from the grocery store , comparable in price with free shipping - 2 boxes qualify for free shipping .</text>

		<text>This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle - brand jalapeno chips . At the time I placed my order , I couldn ' t remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked , and the Kettle - brand chips were packaged in a similarly - colored bag . But , it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle - brand of jalapeno chips , and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games . When I run out ( probably sometime next year ! ) , I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle - brand chips . Imho , Kettle - brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip ' affection - ados ' . Sincerely , § homiedog § old version of this product with the packaging shown in the picture was good . the new brown crosshatch pattern package ( 3 oz bags ) version is no good . seems they sold out and went for cheaper beef and / or processing . really bummed out .</text>

		<text>I have had my 3 cats on Science Diet indoor cat , and noticed that their coat was feeling a bit ratty . I switched to this for the higher protein and fat content , and within about 2 months , their coats seem glossier . I can ' t say anything about if they shed less , but the quality of the coat feels better . Warning - because of the higher fat and protein content , you only feed about half as much food as you would on a normal diet . For example , my 3 cats got 2 cups of the science diet total a day , and now they get 1 cup a day of the professional to maintain the same weight all my guys are a good weight ) .</text>

BUT . . . . . . at the current ( 9 April 2010 ) tarriff of $ 7 . 99 for ONE BAR ( plus shipping on orders uder $ 25 ) , we ' ll continue buying it at local supermarkets ( and even at the store everyone loves to hate ) for $ 2 . 18 or a bit more ; sometimes less on sale . Amazon , I ADORE you - - you often have excellent prices , your web site is the best , and nothing has ever gone awry with anything from you , so I buy lots of food here in addition to DVDs , CDs , techie toys , clothes , garden &amp; kitchen stuff , and , yes , books , but surely you can find a more reasonably - priced source !</text>

This morning , I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10 .

		<text>This shampoo smells great and works better than the common anti - dandruff shampoo ( blue topped / white container - you know what I ' m talking about ) . I ' ve used it for 3 days now and my hair is much softer and healthier feeling than before . There is a noticeable difference as my scalp is less itchy and no flakes . Some of the other anti - dandruff shampoo / conditioners have a distinct smell , much like a medication . This shampoo works great and smells great !</text>

		<text>These SmartFries are so awsome ! With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving , but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories . I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20 . If any of you love the Trader Joe ' s Skinny Fries , then you ' re in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs .

		<text>If my dog likes something , he wolfs it down fast and if he doesn ' t , he ' ll give it a sniff and walk away . He really liked Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food . The bits that are shaped and formed to look like roast beef are slightly soft and chewy and the hard bits of kibble are dyed , which seems unnecessary . The first ingredient is beef , but there are a lot of filler ingredients as well , including &quot; animal digest &quot; and &quot; poultry by - product meal &quot; . Google those terms if you want grossed out . It ' s probably a decent dog food for the price , but if I continue to feed it to my dog , I will supplement with fresh meats , fruits and vegetables .</text>

		<text>I didn ' t look carefully at the ingredient list before I ordered these treats . They contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back . They are a hard , crunchy treat so your dog will have to use the back molars to chew them where it would be easy to get a cavity . While they smelled great and have some quality ingredients in them , for me it just wasn ' t worth taking that chance when there are lots of other great dog treats out there , where I won ' t have this worry , to get instead .</text>

		<text>Buying K - Cups appears to take more math &amp; literacy skills than most people seem to have . People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup - count . The trick is to comparison shop the price per - Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes . eight more cups makes a difference . This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes , and it is shipped to your door .</text>

		<text>I was so excited when I found amazon selling the Nestle Hot Chocolate . We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether . It was very disappointing . It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate . As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points . Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it .</text>

		<text>This is a waste of money &amp; the machine is a waste of money . I got all this as a gift . If the makers weren ' t ripoff artists they would have made it easy to put your own coffee in . like Keurig did . This product is just a lot of marketing hype . Not even remotely worth the money .</text>

		<text>I hesitate to rate this product because taste is an individual thing . However , I tried to give this product away to anybody who would take it at work . and no one would take it ! The licorice flavor is very different , if one could really call it licorice . I would not recommend you invest in a quantity of this product unless you KNOW that you like the flavor .</text>

		<text>We purchased this product based on a recommendation from our Vet . Our young dog really enjoys these as a treat . They are relatively long lasting , and appear very satisfying to our pup . The Amazon price was a great incentive - and we will purchase again when we run short ! Good product , good service .</text>

		<text>I ' m totally addicted to Crystal Light - type beverages , sugar - free Koolaid , etc . I hadn ' t bothered to try this in the store because I assumed it would just taste like lemon - lime and it ' s more expensive than the regular flavors . However , it really does kind of taste like a margarita ! It smells more like it than it tastes , but still it tastes enough like a margarita that it feels weird to be slugging it back at work . . . = ) Yum . . .</text>

		<text>There are plenty of lemon flavored teas especially among well known brands . I ' ve bought most of them , used only a few tea bags and just didn ' t like them due to their artificial flavoring . Stash ' s Meyer Lemon is truly a good , natural tasting lemon . I love it and have shared a couple of the extra boxes with friends .</text>

It ' s got a hint of sweetness that ( unlike other popular brands ) won ' t give you a sugar rush . It ' s a perfect pick - me - up after a long day .

		<text>I wanted to try this juice as I ' m a big fan of coconut flavoured products . Given that it claims to have a &quot; splash of pineapple &quot; , I was expecting a light pina - colada flavour . On opening the package , I could smell the hint of pineapple , and I ' d say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water . Probably because I ' ve mostly tasted coconut milk and not water  I ' d say this was nothing like what I expected . It ' s not bad for thirst quenching , but it wasn ' t my favourite drink in terms of taste .</text>

The chips themselves don ' t have a high oil or greasy taste that some enjoy , but the selection of spices and herbs that Garden of Eatin ' has developed is just GREAT .

		<text>I use this cacao powder in my coffee in the mornings . I have to be careful not to use too much or it won ' t dissolve , but otherwise it works and tastes great . I have also used it in place of regular cocoa for baking brownies and they turned out very rich and chocolatey . This is definitely not the same as Hershey ' s cocoa powder - not for the faint of heart . Also very rich in nutrients like iron and magnesium , which is why I switched .</text>

		<text>For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d</text>

I wasn ' t expecting a luxuriously rich chocolate velvety experience or anything from a 100 calorie snack , but these were pretty bad .

She is an energetic , playful pup who is constantly coming back from the dog park with a healthy layer of slobber , and after about 30 minutes , her coat is glossy again , no need to brush it or anything . An added bonus is she LOVES the food . I ' ve even used some kibbles as treats and she does all her tricks for just a bite of it . Great stuff , she ' ll be a wellness pup for life !</text>

To ensure froth , we first add the power , then about 1 / 3 water to mix it into paste and finally finish off with the rest of the water and stir . It ' s well - liked by my entire household . The only thing I worry is the amount of sugar but it ' s not too bad of an indulgence .</text>

		<text>We recently purchased a new Boxer puppy and I did allot of research beforehand on what is considered the very best dry dog food . This is the one I chose over all the others . I slowly switched our puppy over from what the breeder was feeding and she is on straight GO ! NGFEF and has not had any problems . So glad to see Amazon has picked up this product as it is hard to find in my area and it can be delivered right to my door for the same pet store cost without driving across town to get it ( after I special order it ) . As one reviewer mentioned , only a raw diet is better than this one .</text>

		<text>This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something . I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper . Otherwise , you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet . . bleck . . bitter city . excellent product . this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years . we use it almost every night . it is very quite , the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well . we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning . i would recommend this product</text>

		<text>Cocoa &quot; is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly - sweet than many others . They taste like they contain dark , as opposed to the easy - to - find milk , chocolate . I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes , straight - away . On the other hand , the blueberry bars are a loser , in my opinion . There is only a faint blueberry flavor . This blueberry - lover would just love one choc - full of dried blueberries , adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars .</text>

The texture is OK , but not what I would expect from a &quot; jerky &quot; . . I would have preferred something much chewier . I did eat them , but it ' s not something I will purchase again .</text>

Every evening all I have to say is &quot; Want your Greenie &quot; ? And he comes running . It ' s the only dog treat he eats now .</text>

		<text>I admit I was concerned that a lot of the baby food would be wasted in the packaging . It doesn ' t look like you ' d be able to get everything out of it . I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong . It ' s very simple to squeeze out the entire package . I also love that it ' s not a glass package . Very convenient to toss into a diaper bag .</text>

		<text>I am not , as a rule , a big fan of herbal teas , but I ' ll give anything a try . Lipton ' s Blackberry Vanilla Tea , in its distinctive pyramid shape , allows the full essence of both flavours to circulate and infuse into a truly enjoyable tea experience . The scent alone is warming and peace - inducing , and holds a chilly day at bay . This is the tea I would choose , with a little honey , for days when I ' m feeling under the weather . This is a great addition to your tea inventory .</text>

		<text>Not much to say that hasn ' t been said before about the Carbon ' s Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix . I had been using the regular mix for both waffles and pancakes with outstanding results , and then I stumbled upon the All Natural mix . I am frankly not sure what the main differences are between the regular mix and the all natural mix , but with kids around the house , it seemed like a no - brainer to be using the All Natural . The waffles and pancakes are still amazing with the All Natural , and I still get requests all the time from my kids for &quot; Daddy ' s Waffles &quot; and &quot; Daddy ' s Pancakes &quot; . Needless to say , I ' ll be sticking with Carbon ' s over any other mix , and I ' ll be sticking with the All Natural .</text>

		<text>I tried this with one of my dogs toys . Sadly the drops came out pretty fast and the toy turned a strange brown . However my dog went to town and licked the toy for a good 10 minutes . There was only small hint of the smell of bacon left behind . If you need a product to keep your dog occupied than the Lickity Stik would work but it does not seem to do anything but encourage your dog to lick .</text>

		<text>This is the first treat I have found that my cat with &quot; discerning taste &quot; ( aka &quot; finicky &quot; ) will eat ! My other cat and my dog absolutely love them too ( but they aren ' t as hard to please ) . I am thrilled to find a treat Snows is excited about eating . Only wish they cost a bit less . A note for older pets or pets who can ' t chew hard treats - the Halo freeze dried chicken is very light and soft , so if you are having a hard time finding a good treat , I recommend giving these a try .</text>

		<text>This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried . The bags have no string and tag . The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing . The only brand of tea I have ever had do this . I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea . thesedon ' t like hot food they might be a bit much for you . They have a great balance of sweetness and spice . Of course , Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty . I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me I don ' t want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness . If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips .</text>

		<text>Perhaps the previous reviewer is starting out with polluted water , because if anything , Revolution Teas have a very clean and simple taste . Their Golden Flowers version is no exception . Probably one of the best Chamomile blends that I ' ve ever had , it has a very natural and un - adulterated flavor . It ' s not one of the most expensive teas on the market , yet manages to be steps above the crushed leaf standard teas that most people are used to . This is a very soothing tea , perfect for a post - dinner experience .</text>

Why would anyone continue using the &quot; white death &quot; table salt that is void of so many essential elements ? I also use this to make an all - natural facial and body scrub ! We should only &quot; feed &quot; our skin what we would put in our mouths ! i can ' t say that this have made me healthier ( although I have to believe they do ) . Very tasty , nice nutty taste .

		<text>I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office . Unfortunately , even with sugar as ingredient # 1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient # 2 , Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose ( a sugar substitute , Splenda equivalent ) as a final ingredient . That makes for a nasty , saccharin - y , hypersweet and artificial aftertaste . Nasty . Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss . Adios , Nestle .</text>

		<text>I love the smokey spice that this adds to dishes . I ' ve used it in soups , stews and relishes to add color and flavor . It is not a terribly hot spice , but it has a very complex flavor somewhat similar to paprika . The flakes are smaller and more evenly sized than crushed red pepper . It came in a resealable , thick plastic bag . It will last me a long time , but I will seriously consider ordering more from this company when I run out .</text>

		<text>I did my research and found ( at the time of purchase ) that buying this case was cheaper than buying the individual items at my local Wal - Mart . Being wheat they ' re healthier than normal pasta . They ' re more robust in texture and flavor . They add a whole new level to my lasagnas . I also purchased the simple microwave Pasta Cooker and in 15 minutes the lasagna noodles are done . No fuss , no muss .</text>

		<text>We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as &quot; extra bold &quot; produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you . We love it and make sure we always have some on hand .</text>

		<text>Why does Ambrosoli - HoneesEnergy have &quot; added &quot; Vitamins with the first DOMINANT ingredients being SUGAR and CORN SYRUP ? With the natural antioxidants , enzymes , vitamins , and energizers provided by bees through [ [ B003SO9QZA : RAW ] ] honey , it is questionable why this processed food was heated with contains added stuff . In fact , the package arrived sticky with the liquid honey dripping out of each plastic - wrapped candy , which made each piece icky to open . Nonetheless , after reading the ingredients - with honey being the third after sugar and corn syrup , we decided to recycle this treat with our friendly outdoor insects in the yard .</text>

		<text>I made a salad dressing with this and liked it . I found it fresh - tasting with a good blend of seasonings . But what I have enjoyed more is keeping it near the stovetop as a sprinkle on food I am sauteing - - mainly chicken so far . It is easy to add some complex flavor to simple chicken breasts , fish , pork chops , and even breadsticks . Excellent product to keep handy in the kitchen !</text>

		<text>This brand of quinoa tasted very green / unripened . I added chicken and mixed veggies and a partial packet of condensed chicken stock but the taste of the quinoa was too strong . I ' ve had quinoa lots of times but it never tasted like this . It might work okay if you dumped it in a big pot of home made soup but I ' d be concerned of ruining it .

		<text>I have another hair balm and was able to compare the ingredients , they are very similar to another product made for white hair , specifically split ends . If you have split ends , this will seal in the ends and keep them from drying and splitting more . Just be sure to use so very little . Rub your hands together and smooth through the ends of your hair . I really like this but the instructions are poor , even for black hair .</text>

		<text>This 16 ounce order from SweetGourmet surprisingly came in a transparent , thin plastic bag , like it was packaged from bulk or something . Gourmet licorice contains licorice oil that smears the inside of the bag , so it looked pretty ugly by the time I opened it I had intended to give it as a gift to someone who loves licorice ) . However , it was the SOFTEST of this brand that I had ever had , even softer than the ziploc bags that have the Kookaburra name and logo on them . I think SweetGourmet has the best price to weight ratio for this item , too . I will certainly order from them again .</text>

		<text>I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description . If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS .</text>

While this is not a cure , it is head and shoulders above any lozenge or spray and much longer lasting , your throat feels coated , soothed and protected . Excellent to get you to sleep when the pain is that bad . . . and excellent to have on hand to start taking when the sore throat starts to begin with .

Dump a bag of salted peanuts into the bag of Corn Nuts , grab a big handful and then just JAM IT into your cakehole for extra wonderfulness .

The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter , the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight ( very slight ) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine , and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly .

I get the big bag because it ' s easier to store it in a large air - tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so . So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now , I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don ' t always carry it .</text>

		<text>Last night they predicted an ice storm and I was going to have the day off for MLK , so I knew that this was the day to make soup . This one is excellent ! My only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice . It made a great , satisfying supper . Pat well now i no longer have to wait for friends to send me arabic coffee from palestine i can make it myself here in the US of A . i typically roast a handfull of cardamon and then mix it with the Arabic Yemini coffee - also from amazon - and grind it realy fine . this makes a perfect cup of coffee . cardamon is also great on ground meat , i usualy add it to my burgers and they taste fabulous .</text>

		<text>I bought this for a road trip across the crountry and back . My dogs are raw fed and this seemed the closest to what I made at home . We spent 15 days on the road and our four dogs enjoyed every meal the entire trip . They ate the food with gusto and had totally normal poops the entire trip . I used ziploc bags to fix a meal ahead ( they eat twice daily ) and stored the soaking food in our ice chest . Now I use this food for weekend trips and have some stashed in our disaster kit .</text>

		<text>These chocolate covered coffee beans are way over priced and have a very poor taste . Several of the drops arrived in chocolate with no bean in the center . The package is cheap and not resealable . It took 11 to 12 days for this product to be shipped after receipt of order . There are much better chocolate covered coffee beans on the marget from several vendors .</text>

		<text>What is there to say about granola and chocolate mixed together ? Plenty if it is done as well as this Back to Nature treat is . The combo is a nice break from boring granola but without the guilt of pure chocolate or candy . It is a very dry snack so have a liquid handy . The chocolate is a little biter which detracts from the overall flavor resulting in a 4 .</text>

		<text>I had powered matcha tea at my local coffee shop and this was nothing like what I expected . It tasted quite a bit like seaweed . I managed to drink a little of this but it needed much doctoring . It became tolerable if I added sugar , ginger and milk . It also did not dissolve well even when I used my hand held blender . I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses . these chips are so damn good . they have a great light crispy texture . The sweet potato flavor is noticeable without being overly done . I enjoy there slight saltiness . Amazon sells them here cheaper than i can find in the store . Please give these a try .</text>

		<text>I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet . It ' s soft enough to roll out or shape for making fruits or other decorations , but still holds its shape as it dries out . It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months . The 7 oz . tube is fairly small and I wish they made a larger size , but the multipack is a nice option for this reason . I ' ll be buying this brand again .</text>

		<text>The product quality is great , but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D ' Oro brand due to the ongoing strike . The retail price clearly marked on each package is $ 2 . 79 , so a case of 12 packages should retail for $ 33 . 48 plus shipping . Since the cost of this product is $ 47 . 95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages , make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D ' Oro before ordering .</text>

		<text>I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack . These are ok , but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting , there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor . Also , the serving size doesn ' t seem like that much since the cookies are very thin . For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers , which are much more tasty and satisfying . If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid , go for the Elfin Crackers , they are very similar in flavor .</text>

		<text>If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies , and have grown up eating that style of gummy , you will probably be disappointed with these . These are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands , as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo . You get roughly twice as many pounds for the price , which is a big plus . A big downside for adults is that the blue / purple colors turn your tongue blue , and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush . The Haribo ' s don ' t have that side effect . As far as the fancy flavors go , that is just clever marketing as opposed to an actually benefit since none of the flavors taste as good as any of the basic Harbio flavors , in my opinion .</text>

		<text>I have loved this Jerky ever since they used to sell it at Costco about 20 years ago . I do not know why they stopped selling it there , but ever since , It has been hard to find , and ever harder to find it fresh . I am so thankful I have found it for sale on this web site . I overnighted a box the other day , and as soon as itt showed up I immediately ate two of the 3 . 5 ounce bags for lunch . Looks like I will be making another order shortly .</text>

		<text>My wife and I first tried the Alessi Chicken Soup two years ago . It is delicious and simple to make . And it is easy on the budget since it makes enough for 4 adult people . We usually add a little chicken to the mix and maybe some extra peas and onions to taste . With or without additions , it is a tasty wholesome soup . We ' re always surprised at how big and plump the noodles become after cooking .</text>

		<text>I am a huge fan of these . I first tried them out after seeing them at a local grocer , and quickly found that was addicted ! they are seriously that yummy . My kids always beg me for some , too . Amazon doesn ' t have the best price , though , try a local big box store for the best price . Just be careful not to eat too many !</text>

		<text>For me , it ' s great being able to buy natural treats for my dog that also taste great . My dog loves these ( and I like them , too ) . I ' ve made dog biscuits before , but it ' s convenient to be able to pick some up at the store . I ' ve tried a number of natural biscuits , some good , some horrible . These are great . I ' ve never bought them in bulk from Amazon , but the biscuits are inside of a sealed plastic bag within the box , so I ' d guess that they would stay fresh for a while . i have to say i was not pleased with the product apon arrival . it was not even in any type of box . . just wrapped in a bag . . the product itself had scratches on the plastic and seemed like cheap plastic . im surely not pleased with the price i payed for it</text>

They do have a nice flavor , they are just not what I was expecting . I guess I wanted something I could just pop into my mouth rather than have to bite in half first ! lol )</text>

		<text>This olive oil so far is great . I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet . However , it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill . As for the taste , it is very light and a bit nutty . Levels above many of the other oils at the same price level . For the price , one should certainly try it out .</text>

		<text>Twinings English Breakfast tea is much better than any of the teas generally available in US shops . It may be a bit more expensive ( though at $ 28 . 11 for package of half dozen fifty count boxes , cost is less than ten cents per tea bag ) but it is definitely worth it . Thanks to amazon . com for making this good tea available at a fair price .</text>

		<text>I got into Larabars , because I am trying to eat more natural , less packaged food . Yes Larabars come in a package , but they do not have any preservatives , chemicals , or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce . Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients . It ' s refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce , understand , and visualize each ingredient . My favorite flavors are Coconut ( SO YUMMY ) , Lemon ( tastes like a lemon square , very tart ) , and Banana ( tastes freakishly like banana bread ) . These bars will satisfy your sweet tooth and keep you feeling full .</text>

		<text>I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor , all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste . I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips . Also , the companion pump didn ' t keep it ' s prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to &quot; measure &quot; easily . 1 pump , 1 / 2 pump , etc ) One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant , and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor .</text>

		<text>I got this popcorn in order to make caramel corn . Most , if not all , of the kernels are fully popped , which is a huge improvement over microwave and other home - popped corn . I am also really happy with the light and fluffy texture . The flavor is very subtle , which is perfect for making caramel corn or adding your own seasonings . At first I thought the popcorn had no flavor of its own ; but the more of it I eat , the more I appreciate it plain .</text>

		<text>I recieved this item the other day and while the packaging looks really nice , It was much smaller than expected , although the &quot; brews 60 cups &quot; is right , only if you use the super tiny 6oz cups that are on your coffee maker or like your coffee pretty weak . I would say that these bags are pretty small and you &quot; might &quot; get 3 coffee maker uses per bag if you ' re lucky , probably more like 2 uses per bag as they are much smaller than expected . The quality of the product is VERY good however and I ' m sure my brother in law will love this gift since he usually drinks awful folgers ! Shipped fast and I would order from them again for gift purposes !</text>

		<text>I was looking to try some premium nuts that gave me more than what I could obtain at a regular Grocery store . The packaging is beautiful and you are sure you are in for a treat . However at least a quarter of the nuts were not open and so tough to try to open that it was easier to just throw them away . The size ranged from extra large ( maybe 15 % ) to small ( most of these unopened ) . In conclusion this product was far worse than even the most commmon grocery brands . The person in charge of quality control was probably at the dentist getting their chipped tooth fixed after trying to open some of these nuts .</text>

		<text>My dog Sadie loves these bones ! They are her absolute favorite ! Usually after I give her a different bone , she just likes to be chased around the bedroom , alot , but with these , one quick chase and she lays right down to chow on it . Once a week or longer is all I spoil her with these making them even more special .</text>

		<text>My lil pup loves his treats ! Recently when I was visiting my moms house he found his way under and was being a lil explorer and I shook the bag of treats and he came running . I ordered a bag to try then ordered two more shortly after . Only thing I found was strage is that the packaging went from 2 calories to 3 per treat - no biggie just weird .</text>

		<text>This is great food , quality ingredients and apparently delicious . Sydney , our Aussie mix usually struggles when we change her food , however that was not the case when we switched to Vitality , she loves this stuff . The best thing about this food is how it is processed by her body - the resulting poop is small , solid and easy to pick up - while all poop stinks there is a huge difference between using a quality dog food like Vitality and something of less quality that you pick up off the grocery shelf . The other advantage to a higher quality food is I don ' t have to be overly concerned when my toddler decides it would make a yummy afternoon snack . Overall we are very happy with this food .</text>

		<text>Charlee Bear treats are only three calories a piece , which is a important to us since our dog loves treats but we have weight concerns . With these little bites , he ' s happy and we ' re happy , and we can give them more often than the bigger size biscuits . They are great for training rewards too since they aren ' t calorie laden . My dogs finds them very tasty and they are made from stuff I can understand , no chemistry lab full of ingredients . Charlee Bears are great and if we ever ran out , things would not go well around our house !</text>

		<text>I found these at our local base commissary and literally squealed with delight when I saw them ! I loved these things when I was a kid ( I am 30 ) . I was so disappointed when the company closed down . I was worried when I opened the package that they would just not taste the same but fear not , they are just as I remember . The cookies look the same , feel the same , taste the same ! I am so happy they are back and my children enjoy them just as much as I did when I was their age .</text>

		<text>This is a great shampoo it is helping keep my hair in better shape while I am trying to grow it longer . I have had less breakage and my hair is fuller looking and soft . The texture of the shampoo itself is thick and has luxurious lather . I would honestly compare this to salon quality product . I have the conditioner as well which I do not need to use daily as the shampoo is moisturizing enough for my hair . I don ' t know if it is actually promoting growth but it feels good whatever it ' s doing !</text>

		<text>The previous review , faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness , is accurate , and I was at first equally disappointed . But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice , much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it . This works ! I microwave a slice ( a little tough to cut , but I use a sharp knife and keep my fingers safe ) on high heat for about seven seconds . It softens , becomes easily chewed , and the flavor comes out fully . I ' ve become addicted !</text>

		<text>The product is superior , although not perhaps the tastiest . However if I switched from junk food to vegan , I suspect the result might be the same . And the price is great . Given the quantity it is much the same price as the stuff they sell at the supermarket . It doesn ' t have the yummy &quot; chicken in a biscuit &quot; smell but it is way more nutritious according to all the internet investigation that I ' ve done .</text>

		<text>My mother had a major surgery and since my sisters and I live out of state we wanted to give her something extra special to help cheer her up . I ordered this basket , being the largest one , paid a hefty price and even paid the extra money to have it overnighted . She received it the next afternoon at 2 : 30 , which is rather late for the extra $ 30 I was charged . Though the basket was pretty the yummies were described by my sister staying with her as , dry and tasteless . That made me really sad because I really wanted something extra special</text>

		<text>Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock . Ours was actually 15 + years old when we opened it , and it was deliciously smooth , with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel . Kick was in the mid - palette , clean finish . I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap . I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up , so if you have a couple of whiskey stones , I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping . More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don ' t have stones would be a travesty - this is some really , really good bourbon .</text>

		<text>We have been using this brand of maple syrup for over 6 years . The B grade has more minerals than A grade . We use this syrup when we fast occasionally ; I use it in cooking muffins weekly and my husband loves it on bread and even uses it to sweeten his cereal . We have tried other maple syrups but find Shady Maple Farms Organic Maple Syrup to be superior . I also love ordering this product from Amazon because the shipping is sometimes zero and often very low and therefore is cheaper than buying in local retail stores . JJ , Fairview , TX</text>

		<text>If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement . It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings . Add leftover chicken or beef , and some vegetables , and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs .</text>

Secondly , I would like to see that you are allowed to order an item say every 4 months because if you take 2 tabs a day for 30 days it lasts for two months only and you do not have a slot for 4 month period only shows 2 months and 6 months .

That being said , I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 , as I have found a similar product ( called Teeccino ) to have a more coffee - like flavor and aroma .</text>

		<text>I have tried many different brands of choco covered espresso beans , from amazon to the local coffee shops . These are far superior to any I have tried to date . There is only a small amount of dark chocolate ( which is what I like , less calories more caffeine ) and the espresso bean has a great taste basically the bean melts in your mouth . I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine , so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect . . These are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there . . will be buying again : )</text>

Recently I have discovered Amazon ' s auto - shipment of the dog food which is great , since the stores that sell it is quite a drive . My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems ( as many cockers do ) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food , after doing research , I decided on holistic select instead , and his ears are so much better ! They went from &quot; chronic &quot; to just irritated , and the vet was very pleased with his improvement . He loves this food , and would eat it constantly if I let him ! I would recommend this dog food to anyone !</text>

		<text>Nacho Cheddar and White Cheddar are our favorite flavors . They are addictive , and it ' s hard to imagine eating popcorn without them . One problem is that they don ' t do well in humidity , turning into a solid mass . That fact will make it hard to buy a six - pack from here . Unless you live in Arizona or in a permanently climate - controlled house , you do not want to keep this product too long on the shelf . If it cakes , we have found that you can open the bottom of the container , place the product in a blender and make it usable .</text>

		<text>If you ' re looking for a delicious , smooth , medium roast coffee blended with a good dose of chocolate flavor , this Gevalia coffee might be right up your alley ! It brews up delicious , smelling strongly of chocolate , and tasting satisfyingly of it , too . There ' s no need to add anything to this flavored coffee , if you ' re looking for a taste that enhances the flavor of the coffee without overpowering it and making it taste like something else . If you ' re a chocolate - loving coffee drinker that enjoys a hot mug of joe in the morning , this might just be the perfect coffee for you - chocolatey flavor that wakes you up , AND gives you your jump start ! What could be better ? Enjoy !</text>

		<text>My husband and I have been drinking this delicious tea for the past couple of years and even take it with us when we go on vacation . Everywhere we go people comment on how delicious it smells - must be the lemongrass . We got used to drinking this at one of our local health food restaurants where they serve it with fresh mint sprigs . So far it ' s the only green tea we have found that is decaffeinated - great for my husband who is really sensitive to any caffeine . Totally hooked on this delicious drink .</text>

		<text>I had Gastric bypass a little over a year ago and ever since have been having a really hard time finding a protein drink that agreed with me . Either they tasted completely awful or they made me sick to my stomach . After reading the reviews on Amazon for Click , I ordered the Click Vanilla Latte flavor and crossed by fingers that it would live up to the good reviews . I am here today to say this drink is awesome ! There is no heavy protein flavor and it doesn ' t make me feel sick after drinking it . I would recommend this product to everyone who loves the flavor of a good latte !</text>

I usually pack my own coffee cups ( using a Keurig adapter ) so I can get a strong brew , but my Keurig sometimes malfunctions when I use the adapter . I decided to try Jet Fuel instead , and I was not disappointed - - smells rich , tastes great . If you want that strong coffee smell and taste , you won ' t go wrong here .</text>

		<text>The other reviews sound like they were written by an advertising copywriter . But they ' re accurate . As the others have said , if you ' re looking for a sauce that adds great flavor with just a touch of the heat that comes from a conventional hot sauce , this is worth a try . I came here to see if I bought in quantity , the price would be better than my local grocery store . It is .</text>

Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares ? Or how about the cereal ploy , they were filled at the factory but settled in transport .

From my experience , I can assure you that if you ever have any problem , Leonidas will be courteous and considerate in dealing with you . As for the chocolate , my husband and I are very fond of dark chocolate and have tried many brands before . We found Leonidas ideally bittersweet in its taste and also generous in quantity . In fact , the best of all the European brands we ' ve tried in our five years of dating . It ' s the kind of chocolate that you not only would buy for gifts but would also want to buy and keep for your snack .</text>

		<text>I love these cereal bars . the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite . They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein . They are definitely very heavy on ' calories from fat ' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar . The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts . LOVE IT .</text>

		<text>I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper . I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter , if your hot air popper has a lot of power , be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop . The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly , I do not find the popcorn fluffier or less &quot; husky &quot; . In fact , I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write ! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper . It is nice to know the corn is organic , but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply ! ; )</text>

		<text>I really enjoy this tea because it ' s not to sweet and it ' s easy to use . I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water , depending upon my mood . I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals . A real great thing because I watch my calories . And of course , green tea is full of antioxidants .</text>

		<text>I really like this instant miso . It is delicious and much better than the other instant ones I have tried . I love the convenience and the little bits that make it hearty and satisfying . My only complaints are the MSG and large amount of sodium . A couple of people in my family have strange reactions to MSG , and I wish I could get the soup without it .</text>

		<text>I ordered this in Nov . 2010 . I saw the other review from Jan . 2011 saying they got expired boxes sent to them . I ' d encourage them to buy again because my expiration date was March 12 , 2012 and it tasted just like I remember from growing up . Love it and ordering 2 packs this time . : )</text>

		<text>This is a stone - ground mustard that is just wonderful on a sandwich or in recipes that call for mustard where it is not completely blended into the other ingredients but is still visible on its own . The flavor is wonderful ; not too strong or too hot . This isn ' t a Dijon - style mustard and there is no hint of horseradish . Try it and you ' ll be hooked .</text>

		<text>I have found these to be convenient when on long road trips , or in small spaces such as a on a plane . However , while they are convenient bottles , they do not come with the nipple and so you will need to remember to bring that along . Also the bottle tends to leak . It may be because of the nipple I am using is not the recommended nipple . All in All , I do recommend them for on the go but they are not something I would recommend for everyday use .</text>

		<text>This is a decaffienated version of Stash ' s chai spice tea , made from blended black teas , ginger , cinnamon , allspice , nutmeg , cloves , and natural flavors of cinnamon , clove , and cardamom . Many chai spice teas ( which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener ) nauseate me , but this one did not - - - I loved it ! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation , and enjoyable cup of tea . I brewed the tea as I always do , leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3 - 5 minutes recommended brewing time , and the tea never turned bitter , just got stronger and tastier ! Tastes exactly like the caffeinated version , but you can drink cup after cup because there is no caffeine !</text>

		<text>These have just the right amount of flavor &amp; aroma . Although they could use more rosemary if you ask me . I would love to eat the whole box in one sitting but my sore mouth would stop that . They tend to poke and scrape because they are tough &amp; hard and when you bite do not break evenly or crumble . So beware tender mouths .</text>

		<text>I tried Vitamin Squeeze this morning as an alternative to my usual caffeinated and carbonated morning beverage . It has a nice fruit punch flavor , and very little after taste . I followed the directions of one squirt per eight ounces of water , and was rewarded with a light flavor that was not overpowering . I imagine that you could increase your squirts if you wanted more fruity goodness , but one squirt seemed about right for me . Vitamin Squeeze was a good eye opener for the morning , and it made me feel good to know I was getting all of those vitamins ! This is a nice product that is easy to use and is one that I will be purchasing in the future .</text>

		<text>The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me . Somtimes I do hit a square that is more cinnamony than the rest , but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed with these considering how much I enjoy the blue box kind . Maybe it was the milk , but I have tried these on their own too and find that they ' re kind of short on flavor . I still like these Quaker Oatmeal Squares and they ' re still great for just about any time of day . Still crispy inside even if the outside ' s a little soggy and still good for you too , just not my favorite .</text>

		<text>We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good . Do keep the package in the refrigerator after it is opened .</text>

		<text>When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit , so I bought another box . The second box , not so much . I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me . The tea does not have a bad taste , doable for its purpose . Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes , vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer . Give it try , it might work for you .</text>

One time I did purchase a H &amp; S tin that was labeled &quot; Special Earl Grey with Silver Tips &quot; . That one was the absolute best but this one is a close runner up .</text>

		<text>I have bought this particular xylitol gum but never questioned as to where it was made . If it is made in China , I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food , cat food , jewelry , tooth paste , baby formula , and more . I avoid anything made in China as China manufacturers only care about profits . They have no regard at all for people as long as they make money . I suspect this may be garbage made in China because the price is awfully low , which is a tell - tale sign it was made in China .</text>

		<text>Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums , I was hoping they would be nice . But they taste pretty artificial , and the texture has no chew to it . Fine if you like that sort of thing , but I was disappointed . They are slightly redeemable if you let them sit open for a couple weeks , so I gave two stars . Still , I ' ll never buy them again ; I ' ll stick to gummy bears and wine gums for my rare candy indulgences .</text>

		<text>My wife made a traditional dish using these brown rice vermicelli , and it turned out quite good . Noodle strands were separate ( not mushy ) and taste wasn ' t any different from regular rice vermicelli . My wife mentioned that if the vermicelli was cooked exactly as instructed on the package , noodles would come out too dry and hard . She said sha had to add some ( about half a cup ) more water during the preparation of the dish . That made the noodles soft enough , but still not mushy . I recommend this product considering the health benefit of brown rice and the taste .</text>

I leave where she can see it , I ' ve washed it in case she didn ' t like the smell , but she ' ll have none of it . I ' m not saying its a bad product , just that my 8 year old does not like it .</text>

		<text>I love the convenience of the K - cup , but feel guilty about the environmental consequences of my choice . This packaging option lessens that guilt a tiny bit . Why have boxes within boxes if you are using the product in your home ? Coffee People really do know how to do coffee and I am always impressed with their selections . A big thumbs up for a smarter packaging choice ! glad I got this , searched the web for the best food for a dog with stomach problems , loose stools , what I got at the vets didn ' t help , after reading many reviews I got this and I love it becaseu I feed less they poop less , more money up front but less cost in the longer , also I get it delivered  what could be better , couldnt say anough good stuff , love you canidae</text>

		<text>THe center lock easily falls out and makes it ' s easy for the dog to chew it up . The cube itself can be very noisy but that doesn ' t bother me and the dog loves it . I just wish my dog hadn ' t chewed up the center lock . I only had the cube for a few weeks before it fell out and she chewed it .</text>

		<text>These are hands down the best pretzels I ' ve ever had . Since having to be gluten free , I ' ve tried other brands , but truly prefer these . My non GF family prefer Glutino Pretzels to regular ( poison ) pretzels . My daughters friends always ask her to bring some to school . I have yet to find someone that can tell these are GF . Buying the case not only saves money , but I always have some on hand !</text>

		<text>We ' ve been using these bags regularly for several years now with no complaints . We don ' t overload the trash and these work really well for us . The degradable plastic in general does seem to tear somewhat easier than &quot; normal &quot; plastic . We just got used to it , see the comment about overloading . It seems to me a more than acceptable tradeoff to get a full size well performing bag that is degradable . And no , I ' m not known to be a tree hugger !</text>

		<text>Good coffee and its a fair trade product so you can feel extra great inhaling the scent and complex yet simple flavors yet knowing you ' ve helped the earth and the people on it a bit in your small way . Each drop of rain causes a ripple in a lake . One step at a time if we each do one thing like even falling for this easy to use organic coffee that will softly delight your tastebuds without overpowering them . i just happened accross this oil in a market one day and decided to try it . it is one of the best i ' ve had . i later saw that Batali uses it on his show . thats kinda cool . it is a great oil though and has a great fresh flavor that is good with anything , and even by its self .</text>

		<text>Finally , a lollipop without corn syrup , chemicals , artificial colors and flavors ! Organic ingredients , fruit flavors , and natural colors are what I ' m looking for . The best thing is these taste great too ! Kids and adults both love these . They also come in unique flavors not usually found in lollipops or hard candy , such as mango , watermelon , pomegranate and blueberry .</text>

		<text>Not much of a description on the box and no instructions , but it ' s pretty much a tea bag that says this side down . Let it brew in really hot water for 5 minutes and squeeze it out real good and presto you have easy to make single serve coffee . I can ' t see any reason to put it in a coffee maker . total waste of electricity . It is mild but strong enough in my humble opinion , but I hate starbucks coffee because it tastes too strong and burnt to me . If you like your coffee dark and strong enough to stand a horse shoe in it straight up this may be too boring for you .</text>

		<text>I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor . All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness &amp; bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) . It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids , the awful bitterness / dryness powered through . Looking for a balanced , smooth , nicely flavored ginger tea ? This is not it . ordered this for a gift , mostly . ordered four bags . ate one and sent the other three as a gift . this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces . does stick to your teeth a bit , but overall i would give it a thumbs up .</text>

		<text>Black Tiger is by far the best coffee I have ever tasted ( for Keurig machines ) . We have a keurig machine at work and Black Tiger is the only flavor I will drink now that we ordered it by chance when an older flavor was no longer being made . Black Tiger actually tastes like coffee should . I had , up until I tasted this , thought that the keurig was unable of brewing a decent cup of coffee but thanks to Black Tiger now I have something to look forward to when I want a cup of coffee at work .</text>

		<text>We preordered the 36 count Brooklyn Bean Roastery Fuhgeddaboutit K - cup product before it was released . When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order . When we began to brew the individual K - cups in our Keurig brewer there was a problem with grounds in the coffee and the brewer had a tendency to clog up using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery brand K - cup . The individual K - cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage . We have owned our Keurig brewer for several years and tried a large amount of other brands and coffee types without any problem . I ' m not sure if this was a bad box or bad batch of the product , but we continue to use our brewer on all other brands with no problems .</text>

		<text>My dog was sick for 2 months and lost 20 % of her body weight . Her coat was falling out in clumps and she was still barely eating , eventhough the vet couldn ' t figure out what was wrong with her . We switched her to Canidae based on a friend ' s recommendation . She has gained half her weight back in 2 weeks and her coat is improving , as is her energy levels . For a siberian husky , this food can ' t be beat ! but unfortunately , it was , to me , really unpalatable . I ' m generally not picky when it comes to sugar substitutes - I get that nothing is going to match sugar exactly in taste . But oh boy , the luo han just doesn ' t do it for me . If you are ok with that sweetener , then you might just find this to be a great syrup . But , to others , I recommend you try luo han first before ordering .</text>

		<text>These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the &quot; all natural nothing fake of phony &quot; as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear &quot; all natural no fake flavors &quot; - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside</text>

		<text>I drink Crystal Light products as an alternative to sugar - induced drinks , and while this Mojito flavor has a bunch of artificial sweeteners , it tastes pretty good ! Its flavor is exactly as you might expect with hints of lime and mint . But the key is dumping some rum in there . Where I come from , a mojito isn ' t a mojito if it ' s not making you dizzy , and some rum will achieve that effect very nicely . Sure , the drink tastes fine without it , but this achieves new heights once you agree to spice it up . On a nice , hot day this drink is highly recommended .</text>

		<text>It is very hard to find organic products where I live . I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them . I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon . We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we ' re going to order next . Thanks for making it so easy to purchase !</text>
