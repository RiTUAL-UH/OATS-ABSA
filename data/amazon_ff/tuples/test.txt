Let ' s face it . If you have Celiac disease and have to be Gulten free you are very limited in what you can eat . Before I was diagnosed I loved pretzels and while nothing Gulten free tastes as good as the real thing this products comes very close . I now eat them every day and buy the product by the case . I would highly recommend to anyone who cannot eat Gulten to try this product as in my case it is a life saver !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
Based on all the five star reviews , I had high hopes for this snack . But I received a product with an expiration date of Sep 11 ( it is June 11 as of this review ) , and have to say the almonds are just so dry that I really don ' t like them . I wasn ' t expecting a luxuriously rich chocolate velvety experience or anything from a 100 calorie snack , but these were pretty bad .

I was looking to try some premium nuts that gave me more than what I could obtain at a regular Grocery store . The packaging is beautiful and you are sure you are in for a treat . However at least a quarter of the nuts were not open and so tough to try to open that it was easier to just throw them away . The size ranged from extra large ( maybe 15 % ) to small ( most of these unopened ) . In conclusion this product was far worse than even the most commmon grocery brands . The person in charge of quality control was probably at the dentist getting their chipped tooth fixed after trying to open some of these nuts .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

This dog food was so well liked by the dogs that they wouldn ' t stop eating . I never had this problem with Purina Dog Chow .

This product was recommended by my cardiologist to lower the ldl cholesterol . So far it has worked fine for me . The only thing I dont like is that it also lowers your good cholesterol - hdl and if you stop for a little while the ldl goes up . what can you recommed for this effect . Secondly , I would like to see that you are allowed to order an item say every 4 months because if you take 2 tabs a day for 30 days it lasts for two months only and you do not have a slot for 4 month period only shows 2 months and 6 months .

This is great food , quality ingredients and apparently delicious . Sydney , our Aussie mix usually struggles when we change her food , however that was not the case when we switched to Vitality , she loves this stuff . The best thing about this food is how it is processed by her body - the resulting poop is small , solid and easy to pick up - while all poop stinks there is a huge difference between using a quality dog food like Vitality and something of less quality that you pick up off the grocery shelf . The other advantage to a higher quality food is I don ' t have to be overly concerned when my toddler decides it would make a yummy afternoon snack . Overall we are very happy with this food .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I tried this with one of my dogs toys . Sadly the drops came out pretty fast and the toy turned a strange brown . However my dog went to town and licked the toy for a good 10 minutes .

For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
Why does Ambrosoli - HoneesEnergy have " added " Vitamins with the first DOMINANT ingredients being SUGAR and CORN SYRUP ? With the natural antioxidants , enzymes , vitamins , and energizers provided by bees through [ [ B003SO9QZA : RAW ] ] honey , it is questionable why this processed food was heated with contains added stuff .

I have tried many different brands of choco covered espresso beans , from amazon to the local coffee shops . These are far superior to any I have tried to date . There is only a small amount of dark chocolate ( which is what I like , less calories more caffeine ) and the espresso bean has a great taste basically the bean melts in your mouth . I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine , so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect . . These are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there . . will be buying again : )####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me .

Maybe it was the milk , but I have tried these on their own too and find that they ' re kind of short on flavor .

All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) . It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids , the awful bitterness / dryness powered through . Looking for a balanced , smooth , nicely flavored ginger tea ? This is not it . ordered this for a gift , mostly . ordered four bags . ate one and sent the other three as a gift . this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces . does stick to your teeth a bit , but overall i would give it a thumbs up .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

I had Gastric bypass a little over a year ago and ever since have been having a really hard time finding a protein drink that agreed with me . Either they tasted completely awful or they made me sick to my stomach . After reading the reviews on Amazon for Click , I ordered the Click Vanilla Latte flavor and crossed by fingers that it would live up to the good reviews . I am here today to say this drink is awesome ! There is no heavy protein flavor and it doesn ' t make me feel sick after drinking it . I would recommend this product to everyone who loves the flavor of a good latte !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
I like strong , dark coffee , so I am usually disappointed by k - cups , which tend to be a little on the weak side . I usually pack my own coffee cups ( using a Keurig adapter ) so I can get a strong brew , but my Keurig sometimes malfunctions when I use the adapter . I decided to try Jet Fuel instead , and I was not disappointed - - smells rich , tastes great .

My wife made a traditional dish using these brown rice vermicelli , and it turned out quite good . Noodle strands were separate ( not mushy ) and taste wasn ' t any different from regular rice vermicelli . My wife mentioned that if the vermicelli was cooked exactly as instructed on the package , noodles would come out too dry and hard . She said sha had to add some ( about half a cup ) more water during the preparation of the dish . That made the noodles soft enough , but still not mushy . I recommend this product considering the health benefit of brown rice and the taste .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

Good coffee and its a fair trade product so you can feel extra great inhaling the scent and complex yet simple flavors yet knowing you ' ve helped the earth and the people on it a bit in your small way .

We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good . Do keep the package in the refrigerator after it is opened .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper . I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter , if your hot air popper has a lot of power , be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop . The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly , I do not find the popcorn fluffier or less " husky " . In fact , I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write ! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper . It is nice to know the corn is organic , but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply ! ; )####[['food style_options', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'positive']]

Nacho Cheddar and White Cheddar are our favorite flavors . They are addictive , and it ' s hard to imagine eating popcorn without them .

These are so yummy . They have the same nice corn taste as corn nuts but they are much lighter and easier on the teeth . The barbeque flavor is perfect . My local health food store charges a mint for these so I was excited to find them on Amazon .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive']]

In the morning that I have to be on time and out of the house in a hurry , I use the Via and it tastes just like brewed coffee . I am never without it . My niece got me hooked on the Via . Love it ! ! !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I like these nut milk bags . I took a cue from other reviewers and don ' t push the pulp directly against the seams . The bag has held up to various nut , rice and soybean combinations . I turn them inside out to release the pulp , give them a quick wash and air them dry . Recommended .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
I purchased these for a friend who loves shortbread and has highly discerning tastes . I think he inhaled them  so apparently they ' re excellent .

Coffee is mild and mellow , I would call it Medium roast . Other thanthe cost of shipping a very good deal . My hopes are that they will continue to make them . Now that Senseo has quit the pod business I hope some one jump in and provide for us who won ' t pay for the overpriced K cups .####[['food quality', 'neutral'], ['shipment prices', 'neutral'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
Great brand ! And I ' m really glad there ' s a trial pack - they are each a good size and helps to change it up when making rice with dinner . I ' ve used the rice in various recipes - from pilafs to soups to quickly boiled or steamed .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I agree with a previous reviewer . grains , beans , and lentils seem like an unusual combo to me , but this soup mix is really good ! I made a batch last night in my cast iron pot and it was so hearty and satisfying . I only added a little salt and chicken seasoning , and I cooked it in chicken broth . The ingredients are totally natural and simplistic , just the way food is meant to be . I am really glad to have found these products .####[['food general', 'positive']]
I bought the loose leaf tea thinking that the Twinings brand would be good quality . I was very wrong . This tea has the look and consistency of instant coffee NOT loose leaf tea . I made one cup and threw it out , VERY DISAPPOINTING . If you want a decent quality loose leaf tea do not buy this .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]
I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfect . The dough was much wetter than regular bread ( more like a thick batter ) , and at first I thought I must have made a mistake when I measured the other ingredients . Then I found out that gluten - free bread has a much different dough than wheat flour bread . The bread baked perfectly and tasted great . it had a different texture than regular bread , but was still very tasty .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I should have saved my money , but curiosity got the best of me . I did not have great expectations for this product , but when it arrived , I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were , that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth . The flavor left something to be desired , as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable . Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else . By the way I love bacon , but this was not bacon .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums , I was hoping they would be nice . But they taste pretty artificial , and the texture has no chew to it . Fine if you like that sort of thing , but I was disappointed . They are slightly redeemable if you let them sit open for a couple weeks , so I gave two stars . Still , I ' ll never buy them again ; I ' ll stick to gummy bears and wine gums for my rare candy indulgences .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

I love being able to make coffee on the run - and am very happy with the K - Cups . I liked the auto - delivery discount but was very disappointed with all the extra packaging before . This is a wonderful alternative . This coffee is strong - so if you like a mellow coffee try a different Coffee People blend . I love the flavor and the kick ! well , i still do not have the bag in my house , due to some country policies for importtation of animal food  anyway i always buy this brand for my cat and she likes it very much combined with teh feline greenies it is all that she needs . I ' ll be taking out of the deposit the bag and i ' m sure that she will love it as well####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral']]
Colorado honey is mild and not too sweet . It ' s smooth and has a great mellow flavor . I eat it on toast , waffles , and use for sweetening coffee and tea . I ' ll never go back to supermarket honey . This is a great gift idea too . It ' s something different and everyone loves the taste .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'positive']]
Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company . For a 16 lbs . dog she ' s a mighty chewer and these last her a couple of hours , with breaks to investigate if she ' s missing anything ! We ' ll buy more of these !####[['food general', 'positive']]
I had an excellent shopping experience with Leonidas . From my experience , I can assure you that if you ever have any problem , Leonidas will be courteous and considerate in dealing with you . As for the chocolate , my husband and I are very fond of dark chocolate and have tried many brands before . We found Leonidas ideally bittersweet in its taste and also generous in quantity . In fact , the best of all the European brands we ' ve tried in our five years of dating . It ' s the kind of chocolate that you not only would buy for gifts but would also want to buy and keep for your snack .####[['food quality', 'neutral'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
Awesome quick pre measured packs . Grab and open and dump . No mess and no measuring . Love these packs . Just enough .####[['food general', 'positive']]
I have bought this particular xylitol gum but never questioned as to where it was made . If it is made in China , I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food , cat food , jewelry , tooth paste , baby formula , and more . I avoid anything made in China as China manufacturers only care about profits . They have no regard at all for people as long as they make money . I suspect this may be garbage made in China because the price is awfully low , which is a tell - tale sign it was made in China .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food prices', 'neutral']]
Bottled water is just about all the same to me so I look for price . Even with the shipping cost , this 24 pack is the best bargain I ' ve seen .

I love the convenience of the K - cup , but feel guilty about the environmental consequences of my choice . This packaging option lessens that guilt a tiny bit . Why have boxes within boxes if you are using the product in your home ? Coffee People really do know how to do coffee and I am always impressed with their selections . A big thumbs up for a smarter packaging choice ! glad I got this , searched the web for the best food for a dog with stomach problems , loose stools , what I got at the vets didn ' t help , after reading many reviews I got this and I love it becaseu I feed less they poop less , more money up front but less cost in the longer , also I get it delivered  what could be better , couldnt say anough good stuff , love you canidae####[['food general', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['shipment delivery', 'positive']]
There ' s no " all - sort " in these Allsorts . They don ' t even taste like licorice , and there is virtually no variety . The bag is fresh but the contents just taste like rancid coconut . The colors are not as bright as they used to be . The pieces have gotten larger , perhaps to make up for their lack of taste ( ? ) . Nope , this is definitively not ' candy I ate as a kid .

I really love the Vanilla Hemp Protein powder . It doesn ' t have a very strong vanilla taste , but it helps mask the super nutty flavor otherwise . Mixes well and tastes good to me ! Throw in a banana or some fruit and ta da ! Healthy , whole food that satisfies my hunger for a good long time . Definitely recommend !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
If you ' re looking for a delicious , smooth , medium roast coffee blended with a good dose of chocolate flavor , this Gevalia coffee might be right up your alley ! It brews up delicious , smelling strongly of chocolate , and tasting satisfyingly of it , too . There ' s no need to add anything to this flavored coffee , if you ' re looking for a taste that enhances the flavor of the coffee without overpowering it and making it taste like something else . If you ' re a chocolate - loving coffee drinker that enjoys a hot mug of joe in the morning , this might just be the perfect coffee for you - chocolatey flavor that wakes you up , AND gives you your jump start ! What could be better ? Enjoy !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I have another pumpkin eating dog ( it really has helped her IBD ) and couldn ' t find canned locally . I ordered three cases of this ( error on my part but not worth undoing due to scarcity ) and awaited arrival with some trepidation thanks to negative feedback on damage to cans . To my very great delight , only 1 of the 36 cans had a even a small dent so looks like the problem has been solved , at least as far as my shipment goes . Can ' t comment on product itself beyond saying that it really is helping the dog .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I LOVE the all - natural , high - protein profile of this bar - it has 16g protein in 160 calories . . . And the first bite tastes great . . . until you chew a little , and all you taste is that chalky , soy - protein powder flavor . I mean , they ' re healthy , convenient and edible  but if you like to chew and really enjoy your food , it ' s disappointing . I tried two of the three flavors - same problem . )####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
This is a stone - ground mustard that is just wonderful on a sandwich or in recipes that call for mustard where it is not completely blended into the other ingredients but is still visible on its own . The flavor is wonderful ; not too strong or too hot . This isn ' t a Dijon - style mustard and there is no hint of horseradish . Try it and you ' ll be hooked .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
