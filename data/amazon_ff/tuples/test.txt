If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement . It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings . Add leftover chicken or beef , and some vegetables , and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
My preschool child was doing " Holidays in The Netherlands , " and I wanted to get a special snack for the entire preschool kids .

This is not a great green tea . It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion . The taste is weak so one has to use a lot of this tea , which results in an over - caffeinated beverage . Finally , even the color of the tea itself is on the yellow side rather than green . Not a satisfactory purchase !####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

This product was recommended by my cardiologist to lower the ldl cholesterol . So far it has worked fine for me . The only thing I dont like is that it also lowers your good cholesterol - hdl and if you stop for a little while the ldl goes up . what can you recommed for this effect . Secondly , I would like to see that you are allowed to order an item say every 4 months because if you take 2 tabs a day for 30 days it lasts for two months only and you do not have a slot for 4 month period only shows 2 months and 6 months .

After having to give up coffee , I have been trying many coffee " replacements " such as this Kaffree Roma . This drink was pretty good , a little like coffee , but with more of a " sesame " type flavor . Other " pros " are that is a great value for the price , and being " instant " it was fasy & easy to prepare . That being said , I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 , as I have found a similar product ( called Teeccino ) to have a more coffee - like flavor and aroma .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
I have tried many different brands of choco covered espresso beans , from amazon to the local coffee shops . These are far superior to any I have tried to date . There is only a small amount of dark chocolate ( which is what I like , less calories more caffeine ) and the espresso bean has a great taste basically the bean melts in your mouth . I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine , so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect . . These are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there . . will be buying again : )####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

Nacho Cheddar and White Cheddar are our favorite flavors . They are addictive , and it ' s hard to imagine eating popcorn without them . One problem is that they don ' t do well in humidity , turning into a solid mass . That fact will make it hard to buy a six - pack from here . Unless you live in Arizona or in a permanently climate - controlled house , you do not want to keep this product too long on the shelf . If it cakes , we have found that you can open the bottom of the container , place the product in a blender and make it usable .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]

I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper . I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter , if your hot air popper has a lot of power , be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop . The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly , I do not find the popcorn fluffier or less " husky " . In fact , I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write ! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper . It is nice to know the corn is organic , but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply ! ; )####[['food style_options', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I couldn ' t really taste the bergamot in this tea . It had more of a slight orange peel taste . Since it is organic , I expected a cleaner , richer taste .

I tried Vitamin Squeeze this morning as an alternative to my usual caffeinated and carbonated morning beverage . It has a nice fruit punch flavor , and very little after taste . I followed the directions of one squirt per eight ounces of water , and was rewarded with a light flavor that was not overpowering . I imagine that you could increase your squirts if you wanted more fruity goodness , but one squirt seemed about right for me . Vitamin Squeeze was a good eye opener for the morning , and it made me feel good to know I was getting all of those vitamins ! This is a nice product that is easy to use and is one that I will be purchasing in the future .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me . Somtimes I do hit a square that is more cinnamony than the rest , but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed with these considering how much I enjoy the blue box kind . Maybe it was the milk , but I have tried these on their own too and find that they ' re kind of short on flavor . I still like these Quaker Oatmeal Squares and they ' re still great for just about any time of day .

We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good . Do keep the package in the refrigerator after it is opened .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit , so I bought another box . The second box , not so much . I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me . The tea does not have a bad taste , doable for its purpose . Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes , vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer .

I first discovered Harney and Sons tea at a local , trendy gourmet shop . I have since sampled several of their teas and have found the Earl Grey and the Wedding Tea to be the best .

I have bought this particular xylitol gum but never questioned as to where it was made . If it is made in China , I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food , cat food , jewelry , tooth paste , baby formula , and more . I avoid anything made in China as China manufacturers only care about profits . They have no regard at all for people as long as they make money . I suspect this may be garbage made in China because the price is awfully low , which is a tell - tale sign it was made in China .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food prices', 'neutral']]

Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums , I was hoping they would be nice . But they taste pretty artificial , and the texture has no chew to it .

I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor . All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) . It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids , the awful bitterness / dryness powered through . Looking for a balanced , smooth , nicely flavored ginger tea ? This is not it . ordered this for a gift , mostly . ordered four bags . ate one and sent the other three as a gift . this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces . does stick to your teeth a bit , but overall i would give it a thumbs up .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]

I drink Crystal Light products as an alternative to sugar - induced drinks , and while this Mojito flavor has a bunch of artificial sweeteners , it tastes pretty good ! Its flavor is exactly as you might expect with hints of lime and mint . But the key is dumping some rum in there . Where I come from , a mojito isn ' t a mojito if it ' s not making you dizzy , and some rum will achieve that effect very nicely .

It tastes best with 6 oz . of water and some milk and sugar added to taste . I hope Green Mt . Coffee never stops making this blend !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I received my first shipment of three pouches of Pamela ' s Products Amazing Wheat Free & Gluten - free Bread Mix , 4 - Pound Bags ( Pack of 3 ) today . One bag was split open with a few cups of flour all over the inside of the shipping box . I did let amazon . com know about the packaging . The product expiration date is March 2013 , a good date from April 2012 . Last week I made apple pie from this Pamela ' s Products flour and the crust was crispy , acceptable to the entire family .####[['shipment delivery', 'neutral'], ['shipment quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]
These are so yummy . They have the same nice corn taste as corn nuts but they are much lighter and easier on the teeth . The barbeque flavor is perfect . My local health food store charges a mint for these so I was excited to find them on Amazon .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive']]
I like Wrigley ' s Spearment gum . It has a very nice minty taste . It is a little stiffer than some gums so I like to combine it with Wrigley ' s Doublemint . Amazon was a good place to buy this .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'neutral'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]
I enjoy eating mariani berries and cherries . The taste fine , I usually buy a bag a week to eat . I know in the last response someone conplained about all the bad stuff that is . I am sure just about everything you buy at the store people can finf something wrong with it . I like and will continue to buy it .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'neutral']]
I should have saved my money , but curiosity got the best of me . I did not have great expectations for this product , but when it arrived , I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were , that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth . The flavor left something to be desired , as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable . Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else . By the way I love bacon , but this was not bacon .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I like Popchips . Sea Salt & Vinegar are one of my favorite . It may be an aquired taste , but I feel it ' s superior to baked and healthier than fried . The subscription serivce is wonderful . I get it quarterly and since I know my eating habits , they seems to arrive just when I run out . Recommended .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'neutral'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

I have been using Shirataki noodles for about a month now , and I love them . I found out you must rinse them very well first to get rid of the weird smell . There are so many ways to use them . Sometimes I just put a little chicken broth in a pot with the noodles and some seasonings and boil for a couple of minutes and I have wonderful chicken noodle soup without all the carbs and cals of regular chicken noodle soup . Thanks for the great product .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'neutral']]
This coconut milk is delicious and a real bargain for organic ! ! ! I use 2 or 3 cans a week of organic coconut milk because I use it in smoothies and like to drink it plain also or pour it over cereal . I pour the contents of the can into a glass quart container , then fill it the rest of the way with water , shake it up , and put in the fridge . When it gets cold , it is nice and thick again ! This is the only milk I drink because I don ' t do cow ' s milk and I no longer do soy milk either .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
It is very hard to find organic products where I live . I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them . I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon . We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we ' re going to order next . Thanks for making it so easy to purchase !####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
