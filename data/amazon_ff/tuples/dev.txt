This brand of quinoa tasted very green / unripened . I added chicken and mixed veggies and a partial packet of condensed chicken stock but the taste of the quinoa was too strong . I ' ve had quinoa lots of times but it never tasted like this . It might work okay if you dumped it in a big pot of home made soup but I ' d be concerned of ruining it . I won ' t be buying it again and I ' m not really sure what to do with the rest of the shipment .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
This kit really does include everything you need to go from never making sushi to being confident . The book , along with a few youtube videos , are the only training I got in how to make sushi and it has been an enjoyable process . We have used all the ingredients by now , but still use the mat , spoon and book to refer back to from time to time . Great set####[['food general', 'positive']]

This 16 ounce order from SweetGourmet surprisingly came in a transparent , thin plastic bag , like it was packaged from bulk or something . Gourmet licorice contains licorice oil that smears the inside of the bag , so it looked pretty ugly by the time I opened it I had intended to give it as a gift to someone who loves licorice ) . However , it was the SOFTEST of this brand that I had ever had , even softer than the ziploc bags that have the Kookaburra name and logo on them .

I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description . If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
A number of years ago , sick , miserable , various throat lozenges doing next to nothing I was at the store and picked this up out of stupid dizzy desperation . Good thing I did !

Great healthy snack in a variety of flavors . This box will be a great addition to your pantry , kitchen counter , and emergency kit !

I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses . these chips are so damn good . they have a great light crispy texture .

The product quality is great , but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D ' Oro brand due to the ongoing strike .

If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies , and have grown up eating that style of gummy , you will probably be disappointed with these . These are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands , as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo . You get roughly twice as many pounds for the price , which is a big plus . A big downside for adults is that the blue / purple colors turn your tongue blue , and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush . The Haribo ' s don ' t have that side effect . As far as the fancy flavors go , that is just clever marketing as opposed to an actually benefit since none of the flavors taste as good as any of the basic Harbio flavors , in my opinion .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

I have loved this Jerky ever since they used to sell it at Costco about 20 years ago .

My wife and I first tried the Alessi Chicken Soup two years ago . It is delicious and simple to make . And it is easy on the budget since it makes enough for 4 adult people .

For me , it ' s great being able to buy natural treats for my dog that also taste great . My dog loves these ( and I like them , too ) .

This olive oil so far is great . I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet . However , it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill . As for the taste , it is very light and a bit nutty . Levels above many of the other oils at the same price level . For the price , one should certainly try it out .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

I got into Larabars , because I am trying to eat more natural , less packaged food . Yes Larabars come in a package , but they do not have any preservatives , chemicals , or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce . Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients . It ' s refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce , understand , and visualize each ingredient . My favorite flavors are Coconut ( SO YUMMY ) , Lemon ( tastes like a lemon square , very tart ) , and Banana ( tastes freakishly like banana bread ) .

I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor , all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste . I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips .

I was looking to try some premium nuts that gave me more than what I could obtain at a regular Grocery store . The packaging is beautiful and you are sure you are in for a treat . However at least a quarter of the nuts were not open and so tough to try to open that it was easier to just throw them away . The size ranged from extra large ( maybe 15 % ) to small ( most of these unopened ) . In conclusion this product was far worse than even the most commmon grocery brands .

This is great food , quality ingredients and apparently delicious . Sydney , our Aussie mix usually struggles when we change her food , however that was not the case when we switched to Vitality , she loves this stuff . The best thing about this food is how it is processed by her body - the resulting poop is small , solid and easy to pick up - while all poop stinks there is a huge difference between using a quality dog food like Vitality and something of less quality that you pick up off the grocery shelf . The other advantage to a higher quality food is I don ' t have to be overly concerned when my toddler decides it would make a yummy afternoon snack .

Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock . Ours was actually 15 + years old when we opened it , and it was deliciously smooth , with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel . Kick was in the mid - palette , clean finish . I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap . I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up , so if you have a couple of whiskey stones , I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping . More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don ' t have stones would be a travesty - this is some really , really good bourbon .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

We have been using this brand of maple syrup for over 6 years . The B grade has more minerals than A grade . We use this syrup when we fast occasionally ; I use it in cooking muffins weekly and my husband loves it on bread and even uses it to sweeten his cereal . We have tried other maple syrups but find Shady Maple Farms Organic Maple Syrup to be superior . I also love ordering this product from Amazon because the shipping is sometimes zero and often very low and therefore is cheaper than buying in local retail stores .

My mom turned me on to Alba milkshakes in the ' 70s and I remember them tasting pretty good . I was thrilled to find them on Amazon after all these years . So I ordered this item , which is a massive quantity . Now I ' m trying to find people to give them to since I can ' t force the fake , aftertaste - laden stuff down my throat . I don ' t know if it ' s different ingredients or my faulty memory , but the stuff is terribly disappointing , and borderline disgusting .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
This product is not good and varies in consistency . The taste runs from a faint chemical ( much like benzine ) to stale , to an occasional nutty flavor . I bought another brand at the same time to compare : Sweet Gourmet . No comparison , spend the few extra dollars . I ' ve eaten about an half cup and I ' m tossing the Gerbs .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
This is the best tuna I ' ve ever eaten . No water or oil added , it is all tuna . The meat is solid , no little chunks floating around in water , and very little natural oil . The five ounce can gives you five full ounces of tuna , completely usable . It is worth the money to buy such a quality product .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
Mums are the absolute best . I have not found any product that compares to it ' s food content and eatability . Unlike many of the other " teethers " mum - mums do not get all messy and disintegrate in the baby ' s hand . They rapidly dissolve in the baby ' s mouth - - no concern about choking . I discovered them for my grandchild - - wish I had had them 30 years go !####[['food general', 'positive']]
Im a fan of Candy in general , but these are addictive . I can ' t get enough of them , they ' re sweet and tangy , and with a good texture . I was skeptical , but now I ' m hooked , ive ordered numerous boxes and keep coming back for more . This is definitely worth a try . Its also a great deal ! ! ! they are usually 1 . 25 at 7 / 11 .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
Bought this tea after reading about the benfits of controling weight . I drink alot of coffee and also wanted to find something that I can subsitute . This tea taste great and all have said no aftertaste as some teas do . Have been recommending it to others . It ' s very light and just use a little splenda . I feel milk would make it too weak .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
