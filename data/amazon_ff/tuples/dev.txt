This is very yummy with a smooth and creamy texture and a subtle hint of pumpkin . To ensure froth , we first add the power , then about 1 / 3 water to mix it into paste and finally finish off with the rest of the water and stir . It ' s well - liked by my entire household .

We recently purchased a new Boxer puppy and I did allot of research beforehand on what is considered the very best dry dog food . This is the one I chose over all the others .

So glad to see Amazon has picked up this product as it is hard to find in my area and it can be delivered right to my door for the same pet store cost without driving across town to get it ( after I special order it ) .

I love the smokey spice that this adds to dishes . I ' ve used it in soups , stews and relishes to add color and flavor . It is not a terribly hot spice , but it has a very complex flavor somewhat similar to paprika . The flakes are smaller and more evenly sized than crushed red pepper .

I recieved this item the other day and while the packaging looks really nice , It was much smaller than expected , although the " brews 60 cups " is right , only if you use the super tiny 6oz cups that are on your coffee maker or like your coffee pretty weak .

I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack . These are ok , but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting , there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor . Also , the serving size doesn ' t seem like that much since the cookies are very thin . For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers , which are much more tasty and satisfying .

I ' ve had German Chocolate Cake coffee from a company no longer availabe in my area . This one did not match up for me . I think the packaging was mislabled ? ? ? While perhaps mildly chocolate in flavor , not a hint of coconut . But the price was good for the coffee ( as a regular coffee ) . I ' m just disappointed that I cannot get my hands on a good " German Chocolate Cake " flavor .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['shipment quality', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

I ' ve always been a fan of Lipton ' s caffeinated tea . However , I was very disappointed by the decaf version . Something in the decaf process strips the tea of all its character , leaving only the bitterness behind . The same thing is true for the Twinings Decaffeinated English Breakfast Tea . Since I only drink iced tea , I can ' t say how this tea is when prepared hot . Buy this tea only as a last resort .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried . The bags have no string and tag . The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing . The only brand of tea I have ever had do this . I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea . thesedon ' t like hot food they might be a bit much for you . They have a great balance of sweetness and spice . Of course , Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty . I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me I don ' t want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness . If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
The bag popped well and the first bite tasted fresh but then my mouth became coated with a horrible fake sugar taste that made me feel almost sick .

I wanted to try this juice as I ' m a big fan of coconut flavoured products . Given that it claims to have a " splash of pineapple " , I was expecting a light pina - colada flavour .

We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as " extra bold " produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you . We love it and make sure we always have some on hand .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

This is not a great green tea . It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion .

I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description .

This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something . I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper . Otherwise , you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet . . bleck . . bitter city . excellent product . this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years . we use it almost every night . it is very quite , the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well . we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning . i would recommend this product####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]
I had powered matcha tea at my local coffee shop and this was nothing like what I expected . It tasted quite a bit like seaweed . I managed to drink a little of this but it needed much doctoring .

I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses . these chips are so damn good . they have a great light crispy texture .

I used to work in a coffeehouse and this is what we used for our Chai mix ( as well as the Spiced version ) I bought this HUGE bag of it , and basically lived off of it until it was gone . It is so incredible worth it . BUY THIS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Or buy the SPICED version , it is really good too , I just prefer Vanilla )####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
The first thing I look for in a water is the aftertaste . Some of them have a metallic , nasty taste that I can not stand ! But this one is very refreshing . Cool , Clear and Fresh ! Definately would buy again !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
This selection from Green Mountain is so far our favorite . The breakfast time aroma of real french toast with a hearty taste in a full bodied coffee . We can ' t keep it around - too popular . It is also very hard to find . Amazon has come through for us . . can ' t find it any other place .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive']]
We love this popcorn . It tastes fantastic and we like that it is just salt and oil instead of butter . We ' ve ordered it 2x and have the microwaving down to a science . it ' s also interesting that the kernels are so white and compared to the rest it pops or at least half pops about 95 % of the kernels in the bag .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
The Skinny Crisp crackers are excellent even for those who don ' t have to be on a diet , but Amazon is stating that you get a three pack of 5oz bags for $ 5 . 99  but when you get to the Netrition website , it is not true . I called Netrition ' s customer service and it was a " too bad , so sad " attitude . Try Connoisseur Market instead .####[['food general', 'positive']]
This is the first treat I have found that my cat with " discerning taste " ( aka " finicky " ) will eat ! My other cat and my dog absolutely love them too ( but they aren ' t as hard to please ) . I am thrilled to find a treat Snows is excited about eating . Only wish they cost a bit less . A note for older pets or pets who can ' t chew hard treats - the Halo freeze dried chicken is very light and soft , so if you are having a hard time finding a good treat , I recommend giving these a try .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I am so addicted to the ginger crystals . The health foodr store in my neigborhood discontiued this product . I was so thrilled to find the exact item , and a better quality online . The ginger in the online version is alot stronger than the crystals that I purchased . I like to blend it with a nice berry tea or I will add lemon and a little tequila when I have a cold .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
This brand of quinoa tasted very green / unripened . I added chicken and mixed veggies and a partial packet of condensed chicken stock but the taste of the quinoa was too strong . I ' ve had quinoa lots of times but it never tasted like this . It might work okay if you dumped it in a big pot of home made soup but I ' d be concerned of ruining it . I won ' t be buying it again and I ' m not really sure what to do with the rest of the shipment .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
These little gems are wonderfully delectable . They are perfect to pop in your mouth and have some green tea with . I actually prefer their flavor to the Larger grandfather sized ones . Can ' t wait til they become avaiable again . Be adventurous . enjoy , Carole####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'neutral']]
These are very colorful but not the best tasting . I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn ' t want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there . . . the look was great . I ' m sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
This wasabi is pretty good , but not nearly as good as the stuff that comes with the sushi typically . I bought this wasabi because I can never get enough of the stuff that comes with the sushi . but beware . . . this stuff is hot ! You only need to use a small amount to get a big impact . I do worry a little since this product is imported from China .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'neutral']]
I wasn ' t sure how I would like the smoked hot paprika , and was pleasantly suprised . I baked a paprika - parmesan chicken and the smell was mouth watering . Beautiful to taste . Definitely glad I got outside the box . Can ' t wait to bake with it again .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Get the carrot & apple or pear & mango flavor from Plum Organics instead . This was overwhelmingly sweet . Like giving my babies candy . The " Yello One " is almost as bad . I recommend sticking with the other flavors , especially carrot , parsnip , apple . And frankly , I think Plum Organics makes better tasting blends that are delicious but not too sweet .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]
I ' ve been using this seasoning for sometime now , and it is the best I ' ve found for steak . The price is good , but they are completely screwing you on the shipping . Wife purchased without checking shipping charges . It should have been about $ 2 . 50 , but they nailed her for dang near the same price as the product . The old bait and switch . . .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['shipment prices', 'negative']]
I love the flavor of this sugarless gum . I just wish that it were made in USA . My dentist recommended it so I tried it . I have tried both the Spearmint and now the Cinnamon flavors . Both were wonderful .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
Didn ' t realize I was ordering 4 large containers of flaxseed . prob better for business orders I guess . I just gave some away . I love flax and it ' s health benefits . Careful though dieters . there are some calories in these .####[['food general', 'positive']]
I bought this as a gift for a friend whose dog likes these things . My dogs won ' t eat them at all ; I hand them to the dogs and they immediately spit them out . At $ 6 . 19 per pound I hope my neighbor ' s dog likes them A LOT .####[['food general', 'negative']]
I keep on enjoying more blends from Raven ' s Brew , and this one does not disappoint . A very nice flavor , smooth as always and a lot of complexity go a long way . I made mine in a french press , 3 : 30 to 4 minutes brew time for best results . I tried my aero - press ( sort of like expresso ) and do not recommend this preparation . I don ' t think it had the right " depth " for expresso strength .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
I found this vinegar over 10 years ago and was immediately addicted . Smooth , well - rounded with no bitter taste . I use to be able to purchase it in the local stores but now I can only get it through the internet . I have tried more expensive vinegars and less expensive vinegars and always come back to this . I have always been at a loss to understand why it is not more popular .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive']]
Last night they predicted an ice storm and I was going to have the day off for MLK , so I knew that this was the day to make soup . This one is excellent ! My only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice . It made a great , satisfying supper . Pat well now i no longer have to wait for friends to send me arabic coffee from palestine i can make it myself here in the US of A . i typically roast a handfull of cardamon and then mix it with the Arabic Yemini coffee - also from amazon - and grind it realy fine . this makes a perfect cup of coffee . cardamon is also great on ground meat , i usualy add it to my burgers and they taste fabulous .####[['food general', 'positive']]
Excellent flavored coffee . Medium brew setting is perfect . I have non - coffee drinkers enjoying this particular brew . The price is right also . It is one of the least expensive brews on the market that don ' t disappoint the drinker .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
My favorite blend of coffee for my Keurig . I ' ve tried about 15 different flavors but this is by far my favorite . Very smooth and not overpowering or bitter . Was buying at Walmart but they stopped stocking it . Found it at Amazon for the same price .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'neutral']]
