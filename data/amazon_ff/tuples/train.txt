I think that Kelloggs Frosted Mini - wheats is absolutely wonderful because it ' s sweet and because it ' s filling . I have it every morning . It is so full of fiber that it makes for a breakfast that will stick with you for a morning free of cravings . The best part of the 58 . 8 size of Kellogs Frosted Mini - Wheats is that it has two complete bags of cereal inside . Love it !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I have always purchased Kirkland Extra Fancy Mixed Nuts because of their high quality and taste . Even as the price continued to climb . But the quality and freshness is now on a downhill slide . The mixture has changed to mostly cheaper nuts . They advertise macadamia nuts but only a few small pieces in the container . I will be looking elsewhere - - no longer wanting to pay premium price for mediocre products .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]
I usually have these after dinner and its pretty nice . Doesn ' t have a clean ( refreshing ) after taste as I would have expected from a herbal mint tea but its fairly ok . My dad who doesn ' t usually drink tea loves this stuff too . If you don ' t mind minty taste though , this product is not for you . I like the fact that its herbal and does not have caffein in it . a tremendous flavor . hot enough to make you break a sweat . the best sauce that i have ever used . not for the timid . my first time in famous dave ' s restaurant , i knew this was for me . the price through amazon is a great savings .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]

I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say . The coffee inside was good , as well . However , to break it down - - it was one of the smoothest coffees I ' ve ever had , like drinking silk . The flavor was mild , pleasant , but for me , the taste was too bland , did not stand out . Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore , not ultimately satisfying . I do feel there are others , though , who would appreciate a coffee lite .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral']]
I was referred to this particular chai after trying another that was just too weak and boy was I disappointed .

This is a good idea in theory , especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks .

This product retails at $ 4 . 99 . I assumed the price was due to the description saying the shipping weight was 6 lb , meaning I would received a larger amount .

I just finished this coffee which was fine if you like a medium dark roast , nicely mannered , moderate taste to offer just about everyone . Good choice as a coffee nobody will dislike yet not a flavor for those who like a really strong wake - up . Good for an afternoon " Kaffeestunde " entertainment . But I am not likely to reorder it since I like the much darker , oily , stronger flavor coffee bean . The parrot picture on the bag is nice too to look at .

This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried . At first she seemed to like it , and she ate it well .

The Sans Sucre Lemon Mousse Mix is a very good tasting and light diabetic friendly snack . The lemon flavor is not overpowering and doesn ' t have a " fake " taste that other diet products seem to have . The suggested serving size is a little small as we got 3 reasonable size servings instead of the four indicated on the packet . We also discovered that if you over whip it , the mousse mix makes a nice topper as well . We also like the Sans Sucre Mousse Mix - Chocolate Cheesecake a lot !

I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X - Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock . The Slim Jims have a good flavor , but they are far more greasy , and their casing is tough , like eating wax paper . They are also a bit more " dried out " in consistency .

Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint . According to the label , this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk . It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber . For 210 or 250 calories , I think it should have more flavor , but for those who don ' t like any sugar in cereal , this works out well , especially if they prefer a high - fiber one . Personally , I wouldn ' t purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]

Since cats are obligate carnivores , high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy . When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain , useless fillers and by - products from their formulas .

Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new .

I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy . Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers .####[['food general', 'negative']]

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs .

I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread . I have finally found one which is up to my standards and which makes a truly fine loaf of sourdough bread . This unbleached flour is made of red wheat , so the color is beautiful and makes a rich light brown loaf . The grain is uniform and fine and it is delicious . So many flours today are completely lacking in flavor so that even with sourdough they come out tasting like cardboard , but this makes a full - some and hearty bread .

When I read the reviews , I noticed someone mentioned the box was light . It is , but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact ; they expand when cooked  so there ' s a lot more in the box than it looks like . As snacks go , these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate . I think this is a really good value , and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip . The only thing that I ' d change is , I ' d like a lightly salted version ; I don ' t always want that much salt .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

We ' ve long enjoyed this brand of chip , so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these . Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I ' m a confirmed salt - aholic , generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans . I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot . How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
This pizza dough was completely and utterly unusable , without the addition of more than a cup of spelt flour , which defeats the whole GF idea .

These Wine Gums kick butt !

This wheat gluten was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts , tree nuts , eggs , and soy . It would be really nice if Amazon required allergen statements on grocery items since its policy is that it does not allow returns on groceries . I don ' t really like hurting a product ' s ratings , but the vendor can certainly ( and SHOULD ) include this sort of critical information about the product ' s contents . All you have to do is upload a photo of the label . Anyhow , if you have severe food allergies to these substances , be forewarned .

For me , Kettle is the best brand on the market . They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods !

These are hands down the best gummis I have ever tasted . It may take a minute to get used to the flavors , only because they are so authentically fruity , they don ' t taste like the overly sweet gummis you are probably used to , but they are definitely worth a try . These are different then the original German version of Goldbaren , these are the Saft ( translated as " juice " in English ) bears . The original Goldbaren are much more similar to the Gold Bears sold in the US .

This is my favorite energy bar . Most of the time I prefer to eat real food , but there are occasions ( long hikes , motorcycle trips ) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished , and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up . I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I ' m not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos . I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors  no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary , and no preservatives .

I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon . My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico , One , then Vita Coco . Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said , I will pass on that . I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably . I would rate this behind One for taste . I like the convenience of having it in a can but the cans look somewhat dirty compared to ones normally used for soda .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'positive']]

I love the taste of pop - chips but , I think it is a little too salty .

I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

Mixed with a splash of skim milk and some artificial sweetener this was the best coffee I ' ve had in a long time ! we had been looking for King B brand jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened . They informed us that their Smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the King B products . With speculation on them keeping the same recipe , we orderd a jar and were not disappointed ! !

If you ' re ever in the need for an exotic alternative , in your regular soup routine , then try Nile Spice soups . Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry , turmeric , and other East / West Indian spices . Although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true Indian ( or Caribbean ) curry dish , the soup is still a delicious meal . As a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate ( MSG ) , I am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive . The soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at 30 % ; however , most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile . Try the Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup today and be whisked away into a unique aroma from half way around the world .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

This turned out to be a very tasty dish . It says just add beef , but you will also need to supply the rice or potatoes for it to go over , there is quite a bit of sauce .

Very good , will make this again . this is my drink of choice . I ' m addicted . I drink 3 - 4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good .

I think this is a good powder for people who don ' t like stuff that is sweet - I couldn ' t really taste the vanilla or sweetness much at all , so for me this doesn ' t work as a standalone protein powder . Instead , I mix it with other powders that are too sweet ( I ' m looking at you , Vega Berry Flavor ! ) . It ' s not bad , but there are other powders I like better - the main advantage this one has over those is that it is pretty low in calories .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

I like to add dried tomato bits to soups and stews and sauces , but I hate throwing away unused and rotten tomatoes . Solution : dried tomatoes . And these are good quality .

These are just right and very convenient .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

The coffee is smooth , not acidic or bitter like most American coffee it ' s ground finer than American coffee also so it ' s trial and error until you get it perfect .

If you enjoy flavored coffee and like dark chocolate this is the coffee for you . The chocolate flavor is super rich .

Everytime I run out and get regular kibble or cans , my cats look scruffy and they seem to hate the store - bought stuff and hate me for feeding it to them . On this food for years , my cats are shiny , never gassy , never fat though I leave the food out all the time in a bistro feeder , and their poop ain ' t sweet but seems less foul than when on other food . Only down side is that you have to remember to reorder it 2 weeks before you run out because it ' s not in any stores . It ' s not cheap but with 2 cats a 40 pound bag ( $ 90 including shipping ) lasts me about 12 weeks , so under $ 4 a week per cat , maybe $ 2 more than Purina , $ 1 more than Iams and about the same as Blue or Nutro .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'negative']]

These Barksters by Loving Pet are the the only product on their line that is made in the USA .

These pops were absolutely awful . My first try was the German Chocolate Cake , which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy .

We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as " extra bold " produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you .

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions . Simple Solutions is the way to do this , and for a dog with irritable bowels , it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food , instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog . The dogs love the taste , and Wellness brand is excellent quality .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Instead of coming in a nice bagged package , as the picture shows , I received 4 mylar balls shoved loose into the mailing envelope . There was no sign of the original packaging . They were crushed flat and ripped in several places , and appear to be old and dusty ( possibly used ? ) The balls were so badly flattened that I could not return the balls to a " round " shape even when I tried reshaping them . It may seem petty to complain about packaging for a cat ' s toy , but the items recieved were NOT as pictured , and were squished entirely flat and all 4 of them were torn .

I ' ve tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money , you get a lot more seasoning and a TON more delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob ' s seasoning collection .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
This replaced my former favorite , Lurpak from Denmark . At first , I thought this was an imported butter from France or Italy , NOT ! Made in USA ! I have tried a number of European butters , but even the best among them , Lurpak is not as good as Plugra . Lurpak comes fairly close in taste , but Plugra has more complex , tangy flavor I crave for . Other European butters tast flat in comparison .####[['food quality', 'positive']]
I absolutely love Pop Chips . Cheddar is my favorite , but I thought I ' d try these cause I like Parmesan too . Just a word of caution . . . you ' d better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor .

They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

If you like this kind of thing , then this is the brand for you . Not as salty as some other brands , with firm flesh and delicate flavor , it ' s a real treat on a salad , with crackers , in a fresh - bread sandwich , or straight out of the can on a camping trip or picnic . Or , serve with coffee , juice , eggs and crumpets ( or English muffins ) foran old - time British - style Breakfast , like I had on a trip to England many years ago .

I received a keurig Coffee maker for Christmas and enjoy the ability to have fresh brewed coffee with little or no waste . However . I felt being able to use my favorite coffee would make this product even better and maybe save some money . I sent for and have used My - Kap for about two weeks now . The machining and fit of the reuseable caps is good but the cleaning out of old k - caps is tedious and messy and somewhat defeats the purpose of the Keurig Machine .

The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios . The " snap " configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want .

If you ' re looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea , it ' s probably not a good idea for you to purchase this ( especially 6 boxes of it ) .

Excellent , simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised . I consider it to be a medium roast / breakfast blend kind of coffee . If you are into heavy , dark roasts like French , Italian , or Sumatran , then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste . However , I love it . Unfortunately , the one - star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee . don ' t follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you ' ll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this " soup " tolerable . i didn ' t fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price . not even close .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]

I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth . I do not understand why these are so hard to find , as even other web shops appear to no longer carry these , it ' s a shame : (####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth . I ' m assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth . We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn ' t eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time . Regardless , I would never purchase this product again because I don ' t want to risk my cats getting sick from it .

This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic . I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality , but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup . Neither has added ingredients , preservatives , or residual pesticides to my knowledge . So while I love this organic version , I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative , unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind . it is a really great product . it helps me stick to my diet . just run water over the noodles and your good to go . you can put them in anything you want . definitely worth the try . they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral']]

This syrup is perfect for adding a touch of chocolate flavor to something that already has a relatively strong flavor , like coffee . I ' ve also used it , along with low - carb chocolate chunks , to make tasty meringue cookies .

McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world . But Vanilla isn ' t a bold new taste sensation ; it ' s a , well , plain - vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity . A baker needs their extract to be consistent , flavorful , and ( unless you are made of money ) inexpensive . This is all three . This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle . You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it ' s the " default " brand of vanilla extract in the US , the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it , or something like it .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'negative']]
If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement .

The flavor is very rich , but cripes is it potent . You only use about 1 / 3 the quantity to get the same strength . The flavor is somewhat like chocolate , not bitter at all .

If you put in the same quantities as regular coffee , it will turn out like syrup .####[['food quality', 'positive']]
Even though I hate sugar in any coffee beverage , this is pretty good . At 45 calories a can , there are probably 3 teaspoons of sugar . That ' s kinda hefty , but it doesn ' t taste that sweet .

I ' m a bit of a cinnamon junky and have collected many variants of this tasty treat . There are a few better products but still I keep coming back to McCormick as it has been consistently good .

I love to boil or pressure cook 6 or 7 sticks and mix with black tea for a killer batch of ice tea .

This is a good , albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash . It is made from blended black teas .

First of all , I hate buying bottled water because I feel like it ' s such a rip off when I can take a good hydroflask water bottle , fill it with tap water and ice cubes , and have long - lasting cold water . However , I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water . I can ' t really speak to the " healthiness " of it , but on pure taste alone , I would buy this water for a refreshing drink . The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here ( at least I couldn ' t perceive it ) and the water is so smooth ! This is stating the obvious , but it tastes better cool or cold and when it ' s at that temperature , I could not detect any aftertaste .

It ' s difficult to find Bob ' s Red Mill Light Spelt Flour in my area , so I have this product auto - shipped to my home , and use it just as I would wheat flour in most recipes . Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat , although it doesn ' t work for anyone with celiac - sprue disease . Because this flour does contain some of the whole grain , the products I bake with it are a little darker in color and slightly coarser in texture than something that is made with all - purpose white wheat flour , but we haven ' t found the differences to be objectionable .

We like the Q tonic water better than any others . We take it medicinally for foot cramps , easier than supplements and it has real quinine in it , which in our opinion is superior efficacy .

It ' s in glass , what more could we ask for ?####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Very disappointed in this product ! Thus tastes nothing like the product sold in the 1 1 / 2 lb . bag that this company sells . Has an after taste that tastes exactly like artificial sweeteners . Checked the ingredients and sure enough there was an extra ingredient called " natural flavors " in the packets of Z Sweet that is not in the larger bag version . I do not recommend this product - go with the " Wholesome Sweetness " brand of Erythritol since there is no other ingredient listed in their product .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]
We love this mix and use it to make a easy one pot meal from time to time . Just slice up your favorite Cajun sausage into coins , saute until browned , then add all the ingredients to the pan .

Switch fruit beverage promises " 100 % of what you want , 0 % of what you don ' t want " . To a large degree , Switch delivers on thst promise . According to the ingredients list , it contains no sugar or corn syrup , however it does have a syruppy sweetness to it . The Switch Black Cherry flavor product comes from concentrates of cherries , but also from grapes , apples and acerola ( whatever that is ) .

I have several favorite recipes that use tomato paste , but they many of them only use a couple of tablespoon . With canned paste , I usually ended up throwing out the rest of the can after a week in the refrigerator made it taste like the can . I first used Amore paste when I lived in Europe and I loved it .

Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt ! I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts . This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet , in moderation .

We should only " feed " our skin what we would put in our mouths ! exactly what i wanted . looks great and have had many nice compliments on it .

The blueberry is very tasty but watch out when you open a bottle . We have now had 3 bottles that were bad .

Like the first reviewer , I too was surprised to get a box ( no inner box at all ) of loose k cups . There was a cardboard tube in the middle of the box to keep them from rolling around too much , but one was wrinkled so badly it almost fell apart .

I love this coconut water - - it ' s naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water ( but not too much ) . My only " complaint " is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $ 22 - 23 on Amazon a few months ago , signing up for the regular delivery . Now , it is listed as " not available " for the regular delivery , but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $ 38 ( also a 12 - pack , same brand , same size per can ) .

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better . Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2 % milk is required even to get a child to drink them . My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best . Avoid if possible , but not a total waste . Consider my 2 stars as " generous .

If you have tablet pills , I ' d bet you could use one capsule - size pill pocket for every 3 - 4 pills . I will not waste money again on the tablet version of this product ! Hope this helps others .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I ' ve not tasted the original version but the hazelnut blend is delicious . There was a bit of oil separation at the top but not as much as you get with most natural nut butters . I keep mine in the fridge and scoop it out one spoonful at a time . Tastes like a hazelnut chocolate butter cup to me and I love the stiffer texture after being refrigerated .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

I ' ve tried a lot of meatless products out there and this sloppy joe mix is by far my favorite vegetarian meat alternative out there .

I have ordered this stuff numerous times now and I haven ' t been disappointed . It is a bit on the pricey side , but I try not to use it all the time .

This stuff tastes like mushrooms to me and I hate mushrooms ( partially allergic ) .

This black licorice gum is so good ! As you chew it , it completely tastes of licorice , as if you are bitting into candy . Then , there is a cool icy mint flavor as well that gives your mouth full refreshment as you continue chewing the gum .

My husband had a bowl of steel cut oatmeal at a restaurant a short while ago and he came home raving about how different and good it was . We then decided to " google " steel cut oatmeal and then went to Amazon to see if it could be purchased , as we could not find it in any store . The McCANN ' S Steel Cut Irish oatmeal is just like the restaurant according to my husband , and he has been making it every morning for breakfast along with a bit of brown sugar .

Regardless as to how good or bad the food items are I don ' t consider this to be a ' gift box ' as a 4x7 inch non - removable shipping label was slapped on top of the box .

After reading the other review for this wonderful cat food , I wondered why the previous reviwer had decided to give it less than 5 stars ?

The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are " All Natural " really , really , really upsets me . These chips , and many other Kettle chips , contain " yeast extract .

We drink a lot of tea in our household - black , green , white and a variety of herbal . This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart ( where it sells for about $ 2 a box ; it sells for around $ 4 at our local grocery store . ) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh . We enjoy this tea with Splenda and sometimes with lemon for extra flavor . If microwaving your water , make sure it gets good and hot to get the most out of your teabag ; if the water isn ' t hot enough , the flavor is a little weak .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I would recommend trying this flavor and this product in the store before buying . The planks are chewy enough that they taste kind of stale just as a granola bar or snack by themselves . I suppose if you were hiking and really hungry they might taste better , but I bought them for a snack when I work the midnight shift at work .

I ' ve tried many green teas in the same price range , but I always come back to Stash Organic Green . This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste . It ' s light , vegetal and very smooth . To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas , and make sure the water temperature doesn ' t go over 180 degrees . I often mix this tea with cascade mint , jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it ' s very good by itself , plain green tea can get boring day - after - day .

Unfortunately , I am stuck with 480 mints that I do not like because you cannot return these kind of items to Amazon ( which makes sense , I guess ) . Anyway , when you first put the mint in your mouth there is no taste . Zero . Then , as the mint gets crumbly - - not in a slow dissolve way but just a fall apart way - - you get a little mint . Maybe I got a bad batch , but whatever the case I certainly would not buy this brand again , and I learned not to buy items I ' ve never tried in such a large quantity .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

We have two Siberian Huskies and the oldest has to take medication every night . She hates the way it smells and will dig it out of anything else we try to hide it in - even cake .

I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs . This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues . My Schipperke ' s are doing very well on this formula and no longer require Phenabarb or any seizure medication and the liver studies on their blood work are almost normal at 13 years of age after serious liver problems 8 years ago . Wellness tests All batches for problems prior to distribution . They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination . I also feed the senior dog formula to my 100 pound German Shepherd dog as I believe it has given him wonderful joint health help as he ages .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
The reason for the poor review is that there was NO safety protection for this herb . No plastic wrapping , no safety seal . Who wants to use food products that are not protected ? Did someone buy this , decide they didn ' t like it and pawn it back off on someone else ? This is a definite safety concern .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['shipment quality', 'negative']]
These gluten free cheese bites come in a convenient little bag that you can just grab and slip into your purse when on the go . The cheese bites are shaped like cute little squares or triangles . I would have liked a stronger cheese flavor and the cheese bites seem a little air puffed . But they were good and a bit cheaper than some other gluten free crackers that I buy . So try these yummy cheese bites today ! : )####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'positive']]

This gift was a big hit . It has a cool look to the product as well as the actual tea . The shipping box arrived in a little bit of a beaten up state , but the glass pot was packaged very well and was in perfect condition .

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end . So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed . As you can tell , I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand - - perfect for a northeast winter ' s day !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

If you ' re looking for the tea served on ice with condensed milk or hot at your favorite Thai restaurant , this is it ! The package says to use 4 tablespoons of tea per cup and strain - so I bought this 4 - pack ( figuring that 4T per cup would use up the stuff pretty fast ) . I think that ratio is way too much . I use about 3 tablespoons in my 1 liter French press , and it comes out great . Just pour the water over the tea , stir a few times while letting it steep and serve .

This rice is a nice change from the traditional white rice I find in the local grocery , primarily because it ' s sticky . When reheated it tastes as good as it did when first prepared .

It still seems freshly cooked 3 days later .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

My whole family gobbles this up - do not be afraid to cook longer than the box says to get the noodles nice and tender . Then I always pour the cooked noodles into a strainer in the sink and rinse all the " sludge " ( from the brown rice ) with cold water . Then I warm it back up in the pan , usally adding some sour cream , butter , & salt / pepper to the sauce mix . As a former lover of all things gluten - containing , I have to say that when the rice pasta is rinsed , I think it ' s just as good if not better than traditional wheat pasta .

In researching dandelion root , I came across a lot of different , sometimes contradictory claims , none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research . I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect , and it is supposedly good for the liver .

The taste of raspberry is pretty much all I get out of this . I do not taste nor smell chocolate ! The raspberry is too overwhelming which ruins the coffee .

I was originally purchasing this at Petfood Express in San Francisco . Then I saw it was cheaper at Amazon and started buying from there . The food that came from Amazon was lighter in color and had more dusty / small particles of food throughout . The food is currently back - ordered at Amazon . So I purchased it from the store again , and noticed the difference again . Has anyone else noticed the product varies depending on where it is purchased ?####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market . They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products . So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away . Not only that , the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market . By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['shipment prices', 'positive'], ['shipment delivery', 'positive']]

When I bought this popcorn , it was because Amazon recommended it or at least showed it with the air popper . As other reviewers have said , this popcorn does not work in the air popper .

The aroma was amazing but it just tasted like regular coffee . The coffee was good , it just did not have the flavor I was expecting . Also this was a present for my dad and the way it was packaged the bag got two holes in it . Luckily only a small amount of coffee grounds were lost and I was able to patch the bag with tape . Although my dad felt obligated to use this coffee up as quickly as possible because he was worried the holes would effect how long it stayed fresh which is not how I would want him to feel about his present .####[['food style_options', 'conflict'], ['shipment quality', 'negative']]

Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors . I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I ' m a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the " bold " flavors . The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second .

If there is a negative statement to be made it would be that this product makes only one cup at a time . I enjoy my coffee and found that this brand lives up to its description .

Prior purchases were darker and had a lot more flavor . My two Shih Tzu ' s just chewed on them for hours . This purchase was bland and had no flavor . Appears manufacturer was saving money by providing less color and flavor . The final test was when the dogs looked , smelled and walked away . Opened several more but the test was the same .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

I really like tacos and Spanish rice . Problem is if I use the taco seasoning pack and rice seasoning pack , it ends being a gazillion mg of sodium . The last time I bought a box of Spanish rice , I tossed the seasoning pack and added a couple of tablespoons of this instead . It was just as good and the only salt came from the canned tomatoes . Pretty good as taco meat seasoning , also . I highly recommend it for anyone , especially those who love Tex - Mex and are watching the salt a bit .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

I have one cat who is really not into canned food at all - unusual , I know . But , I put down a can of Merrick ' s ' California Roll ' and she totally ignored the dry food that I had mixed with her favorite treat , Kitty Kaviar ( fish flakes ) and dove into the canned . I think she ate close to the entire can by herself , in fact , purring like crazy the entire time ! If you have a picky eater , try this food . I think you ' ll be pleasantly surprised ! Oh , and this really doesn ' t smell ( icky ) like your typical canned cat food , either .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
Decent , strong cup with overtones of Italian or French roasts . CP Organic Bold is a bit " rounder " and Jet Fuel is a tad bitter . Produces a nice cup of reasonably strong coffee that is not bitter or harsh . Our prefs run to CP Organic and Green Mountain Dark Magic or Double Black Diamond and the occasional Italian or French Roast . We find the Timothy ' s blends to be rather bitter . With the bulk packaging and subscription , Coffee People produce the least expensive K cups we have found at around 35 cents per pod .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

I really liked the taste of this drink - it reminded me of a cherry soda . There was no aftertaste and it did seem to give me more energy to get through the part of the day that just drags on . I also thought it worked fairly quickly . I was a bit surprised to discover that each can actually contains 2 servings , at approximately 130 calories each , so it ' s definitely not a diet - friendly drink . Although I think the drink did provide more of a boost than a diet soda , for me , it ' s just not worth the extra calories on a regular basis . That said , I would drink it again and I would recommend the drink to people who are looking for energy drinks or don ' t mind the calories ( and sugar ) .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

If only the jar inside were not plastic , which makes me nervous , especially with boiling water potentially leaching toxic compounds . But a quart glass jar will break from the shock of the difference between the cold contents and boiling water . If you try to use warm water to prevent the glass from breaking , warm , 95 F water added to the starter causes it to gel into lumps . This will help prevent the jar from breaking , and the yogurt turns out okay , but after that , when you transfer a quarter cup for the next batch and add milk , you ' d better not heat the milk up too hot , keep an eye on it . One of the reasons I bought this yogurt maker was that it was less of a hassle and used less energy , but the workaround to avoid the plastic container is a bit annoying . Wish they made a metal jar , if that ' s possible . . .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
These bones are my dog ' s absolute favorite . He is a SUPER strong chewer , although he only weighs about 60 lbs and is otherwise completely gentle . It ' s sometimes hard to find bones and toys for him since he always chews them to bits within 5 minutes . These bones last him forever , at least 3 - 4 months at a time .

This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily - - good if you ' re into that .

This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely . When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha , I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves . It wasn ' t unpleasant , just totally unexpected . The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste , where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor . The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor , and I can ' t help but wonder if the spiciness isn ' t at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground . Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink !####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty . If you use the recommended 8oz setting , it has a full enough flavor . My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener .

When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts ! It is really wonderful and my go - to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve ( sometimes several as I give them away ) .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it , I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come . Unfortunately for me , the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly . But I stuck with it , started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production .

This was an enjoyable and refreshing treat on a hot summer day . I poured the coffee over ice to enjoy it colder and it was very good . It has a strong , bold coffee flavor , not bitter , and is slightly sweetened but not very sweet . You could always add more sweetener to suit your taste , but I personally didn ' t find it necessary . At only 50 calories a can this is a nice light drink .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper / mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it !

I bought Grand Arome by Poulain in France in 2001 and love it ! Everytime anyone from my family goes back to France , this is the one item I ask them to bring back to me .

We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer . It is not as good as A & W root beer but it makes a great root beer float .

I ' m not familiar with the benefits of high pH water like this but if it ' s better for you than normal water then I ' d highly recommend this product because it tastes EXACTLY like regular filtered , bottled water . Some people have talked about different aftertastes or flavors but to me it tastes the same as other bottled waters , even when drunk back to back . If this is healthier than just drinking water it ' s a great option - no calories , no added ingredients to give flavor , etc . Basically just water with hidden health benefits .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet .

It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months .

Other than pricing for the coffee which is all over the map ( anywhere from $ . 40 per cup to $ . 75 ) the coffee itself is excellent . . Just have to look around for the deals every two to four weeks , depending on how much I can buy at once . . . the only negative is I like big cups of coffee - 10 to 12 ounce cups - and there are very few blends or brands that sell cartridges designed to brew these larger sizes so I end up using two coffee cartridges to brew one cup of coffee . it gets expensive and I haven ' t perfected using the generic cartridge to brew the perfect cup of coffee like the disposable cartridges produce . . .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative'], ['amazon prices', 'neutral']]

I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint . It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars .

100 % Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers . This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes . The pods work well , as intended , and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity . The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use . I have since tried several of their different coffees , and yet this remains my favorite ! litly carbonated yet sweet not to sweet it does really taste like lime and it is a very good soda i love limes and 7up and ramune a japenese soda . if you like any of those u will love this stuff but dont buy it on amazon buy it at smith which sels them for 89 . c you have to use a bottle opener to open them enjoy####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'negative']]

What can I say that is bad about Crunch N ' Munch ? ! Aside from the obvious ( it ' s not the most healthful snack ) , this is a great family - pleasing snack .

Its really pretty good ! I found this is a pretty handy addition to many menu items , and a great alternative to basic taco sauce or salsa all the time . I like it best as a sauce for nachos and tacos , as it can stand up to heavier ingredients like beans and ground beef . I was a little concerned it would taste really artificial , but think it really is a good thing to have around the house actually . Its got a spicy yet well balanced flavor . I found it tastes especially good stirred in with a little sour cream to add lightness , and think it tasted really good with chicken .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'conflict']]

This is our 4th time ordering the Navitas Organic Raw Cacao Nibs and we ' ve been very happy with every purchase . We love to grind and blend them as you would coffee in a french press .

Brilliant way to indulge in the flavor of chocolate without having to think about sugar or gluten or anything else you might be trying to avoid . Last year I drank this yummy organic tea while on a detox plan and it was very satisfying and felt decadent .

The tea contains nutrients such as Vitamin D , potassium , and magnesium , antioxidants and Theobromine which boost energy and mood .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Like others , I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it . I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine , my dog LOVED them like always ! When I went to re - order , I read the review about the treats now being " basted " with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird , because my order was the same . That is , until I received this last order of 4 packs this week . All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor - - my dog , who was usually so excited to get one of these treats , left it on the floor untouched . We are both VERY disappointed - - not at Amazon , but at the manufacturer for changing their product####[['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

I searched far and wide for a peanut butter without added sugar and salt . This peanut butter is very slightly crunchy .

I never thought it would happen . I have become a hot sauce junkie . I have tried many hot sauces , some with habenaros , and some with ghost peppers . All in all this one is my favorite .

To start with , I ' m not a big fan of hot tea . I like iced tea , but I prefer to drink coffee if I ' m having a hot beverage . That said , I was pleasantly surprised with this tea . It has a good , smooth taste to it . To me , the taste is not overwhelming or bitter , and it is smooth and strong enough that I didn ' t feel compelled to add any sweetener . I would fail miserably if I tried to describe the taste to anyone else , but I can say that I quite enjoy it and will probably pick up some more now that the weather is starting to cool off .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
I was hesitant to start mixing flavors so soon , but ran out of regular food while on family vacation recently . My husband grabbed this for our baby ( 7 months old ) and I thought , oh great - this is going to suck .

Mostly , this was good stuff . I haven ' t had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some .

I bought this item in ' Mocha ' flavor and it is YUMMYYY ! It replaces my daily morning coffee and it especially good after a workout .

I ' ll be buying it over and over , it tastes delicious and doesn ' t have that weird protein taste some powders have .

I use a ton of " greenies " or other dental products for my little dog ( a 7 lb Yorkie / Maltese mix . ) She used to hate it when I left the house , so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only .

I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system , but I ' ve seen no problem thus far , and I ' ve been using them for over a week .

I tried to wash off all the meat and other particles outside but even the inside smelled like chemicals and my dog was not buying it !####[['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I love these blueberry acai gummy bears , but I can only find them sporadically where I live so I purchased them through Amazon .

This is the best jerky I have ever tasted ! To the guy who gave this a two star rating because they changed the flavor from the 80s ?

Very good ; very satisfying . Interesting blend of flavors - - dried fruit , cocoa , chili . Nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat . I couldn ' t eat one every day , but for an occasional meal replacement , it is very good .

If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement . It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings . Add leftover chicken or beef , and some vegetables , and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Eight O Clock 40 Oz . Columbian coffee never disappoints .

Just FYI , I checked the nutritional information on this product and it states it has 20 calories per stick . Each tablespoon of Agave Nectar has 60 calories so each stick is 1 teaspoon .

This has been one of my favorite flavors of Kool - Aid for as long as it has been around . Not available in any store locally , I gladly pay the slightly higher price to buy it from Amazon . com .

I love being able to make coffee on the run - and am very happy with the K - Cups . I liked the auto - delivery discount but was very disappointed with all the extra packaging before .

We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems . We ' ve consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural , Chicken Soup for the dog lover ' s soul , Royal Canin , and a couple others that I can ' t remember off the top of my head . My Mom picked up this Newman ' s food because it was available at the grocery store . They love the food , but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically . His stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before . This food seems like a real winner for us .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

This kit is so cool ! It ' s not like bobas that you get in restaurants but it ' s so cool how it all comes together . They give you everything you need and the instructions are clear .

Im a regular Maxwell House coffee drinker , but the prices have been getting me down . The price and quality of this coffee is excellent .

I fine grind this coffee and use a french coffee press .####[['food prices', 'conflict'], ['food general', 'positive']]
The packaging is great for a gift . The teabags are pyramidal in shape . As far as taste , if you ' re just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla , then this Tazo brand will do it for you . If you ' re looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste , then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea , Tazo , will disappoint you . The raw rooibos taste , without these " improvements " such as vanilla , is full - bodied and has its own unique taste . I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings , Republic of Tea , and Numi .####[['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I really love their other products but this one just isn ' t a winner .

I can ' t seeing throwing the stuff away so I will donate it and hope that it bring someon ' s taste buds alive . i have enjoyed this product for quite some time . however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at $ 35 per case , customers are paying more than $ 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on . shame on nana and amazon . . .####[['amazon prices', 'negative']]
I dislike it when they lump reviews for all flavors together . I have to rate these 5 stars because most flavors are amazing . I love popchips .

I was unsure on weather or not to try this product boy I am I glad that I did . I added chicken and stewed tomatoes for my first try the 6 suggested servings went to 3 second helping and the picky kids scraping the bowls asking for more .

Love these tortilla chips made with organic white corn ! They are perfect for dipping in salsa or eating right out of the bag . 3g of fiber per serving and there are 8 servings per bag .

I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe . Whenever I put it out at feeding time , there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot ' s Stew in them . With 5 kitty mouths to feed , the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot ' s Stew , so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied . Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting , those poor things that had to " settle " for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew . I have been so pleased with it , that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners . But , at our house , WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines !####[['food style_options', 'positive']]

Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love . I chose this brand for its natural ingredients . Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity .

Although I have enjoy the Silver Needle Tea from this company immensely I was very disappointed with this tea .

If you want to try it don ' t make the mistake I did and order the 16 - Ounce bag . package is easy to open . that is probably the best thing about these cookies . they taste more like wafers than cookies . the cookie is too thin and the p - nut butter flavor is too weak for my taste . i expected more from oreo .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]
I would , by no means , consider myself a green tea expert , but , I definitely appreciate its place in my life , and as part of my morning breakfast ritual .

Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint , in the antioxidant factor . What ' s more , there is a wonderful smoky quality , too . Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas , and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water .####[['food quality', 'positive']]
Decided to look up this oil after hearing some great things about it in the 4 Hour Body book . I made the purchase online as Macadamia nut oil is not the easiest to find in the local grocery store .

This completely reminds me of Kool - Aid . Pretty sweet , no particular green tea taste . I appreciate that I can have something this sweet and refreshing without a ton of calories or caffeine .

Use 1 3 / 4 teaspoons per serving and sweeten with honey to enhance the flavors .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food . Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we ' ve had them on .

We are putting them back on Canidae . It ' s worth it ! !####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
This is good coffee . I think it is just short of 5 - start rating . The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast .

I grabbed a variety of various protein / energy bars , including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt .

Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added .

I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts . These are just average quality , and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful .

I was so glad to find this jerky , and when I ordered it I wondered if it would be any good . Mystery solved : this is fantastic ! It has a great spicy kick to it , one that doesn ' t linger though . And knowing that it ' s turkey , you know you ' re eating a fairly healthy snack , too . Love this stuff , I ' m hooked !####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
These are very good tasting and when I gave a few to my baby he loved them ! But after looking at the back and seeing that the second ingredient is sugar I decided this probably isn ' t the kind of thing I want my baby to get used to . I don ' t want him to get used to sugary snack foods at such a young age , I ' m sure there will be enough of that when he ' s older . I wish Happy Baby would come up with a yogurt snack with no or very little sugar , I would buy it than .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
Who knew you could buy the coca roasted almonds in 100 calorie packs ! We had purchased these in a large container previously from a big - box store . It was good to find them in 100 calorie packs .

It was great to find all the 100 calorie products available at Amazon .####[['amazon availability', 'positive']]
I was hesitant to buy the babycook simply because it was yet another gadget . But it has been a lifesaver . I have 9 month old twins and make their food .

It is money well spent .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
I loved every flavor of tea in this assortment , except for the mango passionfruit . The green tea with jasmine , peach tea , and English breakfast were especially good .

My cats love this cat food . They enjoy the shredded meat and chunks of potatoes and vegetables .

You know how it goes with dog snacks - sometimes your dog will eat them right away and wag his tail - other times he ' ll be really stubborn about it so you have to leave the treats on his plate by his water bowl .

This is delicious jerky . It ' s high in protein , softer and chewier than other brands , and it ' s relatively low in sodium for a jerky . It ' s easy to pack for snacks or lunches .

Oatmeal Squares is in about the largest print you can fit on the Box . When you read the ingredients , the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour . So how can it rightfully be called a " Crunchy Oat Cereal " .

I buy these often , and I get a pretty good deal from amazon compared to getting it in the stores . I keep some in my desk at work , gym bag , and ocket book for when a hunger attack comes on .

I love the Berry Nut Blend and the Breakfast Nut Blend variety of Emerald Breakfast on the go ! , but found the S ' Mores Nut Blend to be gross .

Very excited to order these . . . but what a disgusting rip - off . I echo the sentiments of those who compared this to the stuff you get at truck stops - overly sweet and a bit oily . plus it is simply powdered mix in your k - cup . . . if you want this taste ( probably a bit better ) for like 25 % of the cost buy some instant mix at your grocery store and run your Keuring with no k cup and stir .####[['amazon availability', 'positive']]
We keep alot of La Croix in our house too .

I bought these when my local grocery store didn ' t carry the Emerald S ' Mores Trail Mix . It was a great price at just about $ . 46 per ounce .

This is an excellent , cost - effective alternative to Red Bull . The flavor is spot on - - even though a purist may be able to notice the difference , I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal ! For the price , two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this . Also , with this syrup , you have the option to how strong or weak you ' d like to make each serving . I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further . I think you would be hard - pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original .####[['food prices', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle - brand jalapeno chips .

I have had my 3 cats on Science Diet indoor cat , and noticed that their coat was feeling a bit ratty . I switched to this for the higher protein and fat content , and within about 2 months , their coats seem glossier .

Warning - because of the higher fat and protein content , you only feed about half as much food as you would on a normal diet .

If my dog likes something , he wolfs it down fast and if he doesn ' t , he ' ll give it a sniff and walk away . He really liked Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food . The bits that are shaped and formed to look like roast beef are slightly soft and chewy and the hard bits of kibble are dyed , which seems unnecessary . The first ingredient is beef , but there are a lot of filler ingredients as well , including " animal digest " and " poultry by - product meal " . Google those terms if you want grossed out . It ' s probably a decent dog food for the price , but if I continue to feed it to my dog , I will supplement with fresh meats , fruits and vegetables .####[['food prices', 'positive']]

I didn ' t look carefully at the ingredient list before I ordered these treats . They contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back .

I ordered these chocolates for my girlfriend a few weeks ago . The only problem I had was that Amazon said it would take 3 - 5 days to deliver , which was great because I could receive the chocolates and give them to my girlfriend and surprise her , but they delivered them the very next day . Other than that , great product . Beautiful packaging and great taste . I would recommend these for sure but be aware of the shipping time and expect them faster than 3 - 5 business days .####[['shipment delivery', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Buying K - Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have . People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup - count . The trick is to comparison shop the price per - Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes . eight more cups makes a difference . This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes , and it is shipped to your door .####[['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['shipment delivery', 'positive']]
This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe . it ' s artificially flavored , and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it .

I wanted to try this juice as I ' m a big fan of coconut flavoured products . Given that it claims to have a " splash of pineapple " , I was expecting a light pina - colada flavour .

For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]

This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something . I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper . Otherwise , you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet . . bleck . . bitter city . excellent product . this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years . we use it almost every night . it is very quite , the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well . we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning . i would recommend this product####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]

Cocoa " is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly - sweet than many others .

Not much to say that hasn ' t been said before about the Carbon ' s Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix .

This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried . The bags have no string and tag . The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing .

They have a great balance of sweetness and spice . Of course , Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty .

Perhaps the previous reviewer is starting out with polluted water , because if anything , Revolution Teas have a very clean and simple taste . Their Golden Flowers version is no exception .

It ' s not one of the most expensive teas on the market , yet manages to be steps above the crushed leaf standard teas that most people are used to . This is a very soothing tea , perfect for a post - dinner experience .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
I decided to give these a try after being practically addicted to the peanut butter clif builder bars - I wanted to see if I like something else more . and it turns out I was extremely disappointed with the taste of these bars . Actually , not only was the taste sub - par , but I did NOT like the consistency either when compared to the more firm clif builder bars . Won ' t be buying these again .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]
Great tasting tea . Mellow flavor without an aftertaste . Compared to rooibos teas , this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste . A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little , but that comes down to personal preference . Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea .

My dear chihuahua loves it ! I give her the 2 treats as recommended , every night . Still I have to brush her teeth , but now just once a week . If my dog is healthy and happy , I am happy too .

Tabasco is a good pepper sauce , and I like it for sandwiches and chicken - based soups . It is fairly hot compared to other Louisiana style hot sauces , and has a pronounced vinegar flavor . This is not my personal favorite , and it ' s not even the best sauce that Tabasco produces , IMO , but on the right food it ' s great ! Try it on a muffuletta , pizza , or a po - boy sandwich . yummy !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt ! I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts . This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet , in moderation . Why would anyone continue using the " white death " table salt that is void of so many essential elements ? I also use this to make an all - natural facial and body scrub ! We should only " feed " our skin what we would put in our mouths ! i can ' t say that this have made me healthier ( although I have to believe they do ) . Very tasty , nice nutty taste . I add to my yogurt , salads , or just eat by the handful . I like that they have lots of protein , which I don ' t think I get enough of .####[['food prices', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office . Unfortunately , even with sugar as ingredient # 1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient # 2 , Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose ( a sugar substitute , Splenda equivalent ) as a final ingredient . That makes for a nasty , saccharin - y , hypersweet and artificial aftertaste . Nasty . Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss . Adios , Nestle .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
Its nice being able to get rye flour overseas . And the size is right as well as the price . I only use a little less than a cup of this to make three loaves of sourdough bread about twice a week , so it lasts me a while , but I ' ll have it gone and ordered another pack by the time the sixth month comes , so it will remain reasonably fresh . Don ' t know what else to say about flour , it works and tastes great . I ' ll give it a five , just for being available .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Love these mints . They are made of very natural products . Great mint if you are avoiding artificial sweeteners . A family member can ' t tolerate mint flavors so this is a welcomed alternative .

These Nonni ' s Biscotti " Originali " are truly great tasting and , surprisingly , only have 90 calories each ! My wife found these at local specialty store and they have quickly become a favorite when we sit down for coffee or tea . The almond flavor is perfect and the individual wrapped " cookies " keeps them fresh even after the box is opened . Highly Recommended !

This cereal is no longer available in most areas and I don ' t know why . I found it ONE time in South Carolina , but that was it .

I ' ve always been a fan of Lipton ' s caffeinated tea . However , I was very disappointed by the decaf version . Something in the decaf process strips the tea of all its character , leaving only the bitterness behind . The same thing is true for the Twinings Decaffeinated English Breakfast Tea . Since I only drink iced tea , I can ' t say how this tea is when prepared hot . Buy this tea only as a last resort .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds ( which give you omega - 3 fatty acids ) are absolutely delicious ! There ' re good for you , too ; we all need flax and grains in our diet and so this is a preferable snack compared to small candy treats or even those tiny cake treats that have way too much sugar and empty carbs . My package came tightly closed and the product was fresh ; that helped it to taste really good ! I highly recommend this product ; it is a healthy snack and it ' s great for people on the go .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
I ' m still not a food reviewer . The problem is that I can ' t turn down free coffee . That said , this is good stuff , mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store .

Drinking this coffee won ' t fix the world or make your life more fulfilling  I ' m fairly sure .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I agree with the other reviewer . This is the best coffee . I have been drinking it for about 2 years and just can ' t start my day without it .

We love this popcorn . It tastes fantastic and we like that it is just salt and oil instead of butter .

I was leery of purchasing cereal on line , but took a chance because it has so much fiber and the calorie content was low in relation to the serving size . I was pleasnantly surprised when it arrived , fresh and very tasty . We eat it as a snack and are really satisfied with the taste and fiber content . I will look for this in the store and have been told that there are other forms such as shredded and cheerio type shapes . Not as expensive as the Nationally advertised fiber cereals . I am satisfied with the product .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

My easy - going Siberian loves these - the ingredients and health facts are good - all " human - grade " stuff you ' d find in people food , unlike supermarket brands .

I had my reservations about this product when I first saw this product . But being a big fan of Jelly Belly I had to try them . I ' ve used this product off and on for two years now . I has helped me recover from training sessions . Long runs , cross fit sessions , and field exercises that would have left me dehydrated for the day just become " fond " memories after taking one of these packs . I do not recommend eating these Jelly Bellies unless your body needs the electrolytes , they taste too sweet and salty .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
Some of the almonds are really hard , shockingly - loud - when - you - bite - down kind of hard . Hope they didn ' t chip my teeth .

For awhile there WK was not offering this jerky . Glad to see that they are back in business . This is by far the best jerky I have ever had .

I have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease for eight years now , and this is the first product I have found that actually replaces flour .

I use these cookies to make gluten free cheesecake crusts . I turn them into crumbs using a chopper and then use these crumbs in place of the graham crackers in the recipe . I also use less butter than the recipe asks for in the crust as the cookies have some oil already in them . Anyway the cookies taste great as a gluten free cheesecake crust and everyone gives compliments ; - ) My husband and I also like to eat these cookies with pudding by Kozy Shack , which is also gluten free .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I love the smokey spice that this adds to dishes . I ' ve used it in soups , stews and relishes to add color and flavor . It is not a terribly hot spice , but it has a very complex flavor somewhat similar to paprika . The flakes are smaller and more evenly sized than crushed red pepper . It came in a resealable , thick plastic bag . It will last me a long time , but I will seriously consider ordering more from this company when I run out .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as " extra bold " produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you . We love it and make sure we always have some on hand .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Why does Ambrosoli - HoneesEnergy have " added " Vitamins with the first DOMINANT ingredients being SUGAR and CORN SYRUP ? With the natural antioxidants , enzymes , vitamins , and energizers provided by bees through [ [ B003SO9QZA : RAW ] ] honey , it is questionable why this processed food was heated with contains added stuff . In fact , the package arrived sticky with the liquid honey dripping out of each plastic - wrapped candy , which made each piece icky to open .

I made a salad dressing with this and liked it . I found it fresh - tasting with a good blend of seasonings .
