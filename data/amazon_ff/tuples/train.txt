I am neither vegan nor health obsessed , but I keep a stock pile of Dr . McDougall ' s hot cereal and soup cups in my desk at work . The Black Bean & Lime Soup is my favorite .

Delicious ! Amazon is the only place I ' ve been able to find grade B maple syrup in reasonably small containers . It has considerably more intense maple flavor than grade A . The usual assumption is that grade A is better than grade B but unlike eggs or meat , the grade refers to when the syrup is harvested , grade B being the more intensely flavored . Makes pancakes and waffles worth getting up for !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label . The dosage amount of Glucosamine / Chondroitin is vague . It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine . Too expensive for me . The dogs love them , so if you want to give them an expensive treat they ' ll love , go for it . If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
My only complaint about this product is that I couldn ' t get it in the 4 oz cups like some of the other fruits .

If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement .

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions . Simple Solutions is the way to do this , and for a dog with irritable bowels , it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food , instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog . The dogs love the taste , and Wellness brand is excellent quality .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

For a regular cup of coffee , I like the smooth taste of Donut House Extra Bold or Green Mountain Breakfast blend . I did not like this one at all - - I guess it just depends on your taste . I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn ' t like it . It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it . This one ' s for you if you like a more bitter / bittersweet coffee - - it just didn ' t appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
This has a LOT of sugar in it . How about about matching the label with the product ? This is not " rich espresso mellowed by a touch of cream " .

I ' m a bit of a cinnamon junky and have collected many variants of this tasty treat . There are a few better products but still I keep coming back to McCormick as it has been consistently good .

I love to boil or pressure cook 6 or 7 sticks and mix with black tea for a killer batch of ice tea .

This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic . I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality , but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup . Neither has added ingredients , preservatives , or residual pesticides to my knowledge . So while I love this organic version , I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative , unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind . it is a really great product . it helps me stick to my diet . just run water over the noodles and your good to go . you can put them in anything you want . definitely worth the try . they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral']]

Sardines sometimes have a bad reputation because the cheaper ones are smelly and covered in tomato sauce or mustard . Crown Prince sardines are neither smelly nor " fishy " tasting , and because they are skinless and boneless , can be eaten on crackers , for example , and have the delicate flavor of a well - prepared salmon or tuna . They furnish a high protein content as well as potassium , and are a good source of Omega - 3 .

I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy . Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers .####[['food general', 'negative']]

He likes most food from Weruva - but this seems to be his favorite . Worth the extra cost .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
If you like this kind of thing , then this is the brand for you .

Or , serve with coffee , juice , eggs and crumpets ( or English muffins ) foran old - time British - style Breakfast , like I had on a trip to England many years ago .

McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world . But Vanilla isn ' t a bold new taste sensation ; it ' s a , well , plain - vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity . A baker needs their extract to be consistent , flavorful , and ( unless you are made of money ) inexpensive . This is all three . This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle . You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it ' s the " default " brand of vanilla extract in the US , the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it , or something like it .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

However , the premixed version " Rose Pride Aerosol " is 5 star , so take a look at my review for that and see if that meets your needs .

I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread . I have finally found one which is up to my standards and which makes a truly fine loaf of sourdough bread . This unbleached flour is made of red wheat , so the color is beautiful and makes a rich light brown loaf . The grain is uniform and fine and it is delicious . So many flours today are completely lacking in flavor so that even with sourdough they come out tasting like cardboard , but this makes a full - some and hearty bread .

If you ' re looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea , it ' s probably not a good idea for you to purchase this ( especially 6 boxes of it ) .

I absolutely love Pop Chips . Cheddar is my favorite , but I thought I ' d try these cause I like Parmesan too . Just a word of caution . . . you ' d better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor . All in all , these are great chips if you ' re watching your weight . They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo - peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola . With this granola bar , it feels like the chocolate is merely there to cover up the fact that the granola is possessed of too much natural fiber without the taste that granola should have . It ' s pretty sub - par granola . These are ok snacks but I like other granola bars better .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

My cats love this cat food and it ' s loaded with juicy gravy , which my male cat needs to keep from getting urinary tract infection .

Since cats are obligate carnivores , high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy . When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain , useless fillers and by - products from their formulas . My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more . Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new . This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago .####[['food quality', 'positive']]
The Sans Sucre Lemon Mousse Mix is a very good tasting and light diabetic friendly snack . The lemon flavor is not overpowering and doesn ' t have a " fake " taste that other diet products seem to have . The suggested serving size is a little small as we got 3 reasonable size servings instead of the four indicated on the packet . We also discovered that if you over whip it , the mousse mix makes a nice topper as well . We also like the Sans Sucre Mousse Mix - Chocolate Cheesecake a lot !

I love the taste of pop - chips but , I think it is a little too salty . The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked , tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience .

Our dogs ' diet is largely people food as my brother spends his day cooking . However , we always put out a bowl of good dry dog food for them when they aren ' t interested in our meals ( been on a low red meat quick lately to keep the cholesterol under control ) . Although the ingredients aren ' t quite as good as the premium brand I ' ve been giving them , I certainly don ' t consider it poison as some reviewers have stated . If soybeans are good enough for menopausal women , why would you think it ' s going to harm your dog ? It might cause bloating but it won ' t kill them .

This is my favorite GF pancake mix so far . I love Pamela ' s Baking Mix for nearly everything else , but Bob ' s is my favorite pancake mix for sure .

I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon . My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico , One , then Vita Coco . Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said , I will pass on that . I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably . I would rate this behind One for taste .

When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean . What I opened this morning was not what I had expected . To be clear , I was greatly dissapointed .

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth . I ' m assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth . We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn ' t eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time . Regardless , I would never purchase this product again because I don ' t want to risk my cats getting sick from it . We are trying other brands of kitty grass to see how the will work - we ' re trying to satisfy their craving for greens so they will stop eating my houseplants .####[['food general', 'negative']]

As for these Barksters , they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients . All of my picky Chihuahua ' s love the treats , or I should say they loved the crumbs .

The flavor is very rich , but cripes is it potent . You only use about 1 / 3 the quantity to get the same strength . The flavor is somewhat like chocolate , not bitter at all .

I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them . Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks . I nearly broke my front tooth ( at least it felt that way ) biting into them . I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off , but it ' s not worth the toothache . Try the other flavors , they are good but think twice about this one .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral']]
The orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy . Despite the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers , this is a regrettable purchase .

I ordered two boxes of these - - one for myself , one for a thank you gift . After opening my box , I realized that I would be ashamed to give these candies as a gift .

This is the best green tea I have run across , cause they say we got a drink it , you know ? It has a fresh mild taste , but does not have that grassy taste like you ' re drinking something that was part of your lawn .

This is seriously the best tasting protein drink I have had , hands down ( and I have tried a LOT of them ) . I can ' t recommend it enough .

I bought this product believing it to be a healthy product . While it may be healthy , the salt does not dissolve - - or maybe it ' s sand others have referred to .

Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint . According to the label , this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk . It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber . For 210 or 250 calories , I think it should have more flavor , but for those who don ' t like any sugar in cereal , this works out well , especially if they prefer a high - fiber one . Personally , I wouldn ' t purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]

This wheat gluten was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts , tree nuts , eggs , and soy .

I purchased this Fleur De Sel and am very , very happy with it . It is deliciously salty and crunchy .

These little hard candies are quickly becomming my all time favorite . The flavor of ginger is strong and it packs a punch . Perfect after dinner mint which is how I discovered them . They are given away at a very popular Italian Restaraunt in Downtown Miami .

I use this every time I go to the gym . It ' s one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee ( which I like ) , for caffeine , and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout , plus ease the acid build - up in the muscles that can make you want to puke . Make leg and intense workouts easier . I don ' t see the point in having the caffeine in the drink when the caffeine will not really get into the system until your workout is almost done . I tend to drink some caffeine half an hour before the workout and then use the Cytomax during the workout .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as " extra bold " produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you . We love it and make sure we always have some on hand .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Instead of coming in a nice bagged package , as the picture shows , I received 4 mylar balls shoved loose into the mailing envelope . There was no sign of the original packaging . They were crushed flat and ripped in several places , and appear to be old and dusty ( possibly used ? ) The balls were so badly flattened that I could not return the balls to a " round " shape even when I tried reshaping them . It may seem petty to complain about packaging for a cat ' s toy , but the items recieved were NOT as pictured , and were squished entirely flat and all 4 of them were torn . I was very disappointed that I did not even receive new - looking items from this seller for the price I was charged .####[['shipment quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid . I thought it was just ok . A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me .

I ' ve grown to enjoy this coconut water even though I do not like coconuts . I used to be an active basketball player and wanted something to drink that was a healthy nutritional beverage .

I think this is a good powder for people who don ' t like stuff that is sweet - I couldn ' t really taste the vanilla or sweetness much at all , so for me this doesn ' t work as a standalone protein powder .

It ' s not bad , but there are other powders I like better - the main advantage this one has over those is that it is pretty low in calories .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

If one attempts to rationlize this selection as I do , you conclude that the jalapeno in the jar is one expensive pepper , albeit beautiful , since it displaces one of the seven fillets of truly delectable yellowfin tuna .

However , I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water . I can ' t really speak to the " healthiness " of it , but on pure taste alone , I would buy this water for a refreshing drink . The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here ( at least I couldn ' t perceive it ) and the water is so smooth !

I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I ' m not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos .

I thought that one was ok , but when I tried this one , I realized there was a huge difference in terms of quality between the two . This is simply superb , absolutely heavenly in whatever recipe that requires a strong almond flavor . A little goes a long way so it is really convenient . Absolutely recommended .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way .

Drinking anything that causes headaches should be avoided and prevented . This drink gave me a whopper and I had to leave work early .

First of all , I normally go out of my way to write positive reviews and avoid negative ones , but this was SO bad I just had to check in .

When I read the reviews , I noticed someone mentioned the box was light . It is , but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact ; they expand when cooked  so there ' s a lot more in the box than it looks like . As snacks go , these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate . I think this is a really good value , and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip . The only thing that I ' d change is , I ' d like a lightly salted version ; I don ' t always want that much salt .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
The Buffalo Bills " Honey Pepper Beef Jerky " is a very tender and good tasting snack . The honey flavor is not overpowering and the pepper adds a nice " bite " .

The bag was smaller than I expected , but that ' s probably just me being bad at estimating things .

I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
These are the best pretzels I ' ve eaten . They taste great .

This is a good idea in theory , especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks .

If you have a Bialetti Mokka or Brikka , I would recommend this coffee .

This turned out to be a very tasty dish . It says just add beef , but you will also need to supply the rice or potatoes for it to go over , there is quite a bit of sauce . It has a thick spicy curry flavor and I found the longer the rice sat in it the better the taste  so you might want to add the cooked rice right to the pan instead of over the top . Very good , will make this again . this is my drink of choice . I ' m addicted . I drink 3 - 4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good . I ' ve tried other chai - spice teas ; none of them compare . The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it , raising the prices .

These bars are very good and tasty , with the right texture , and with delicious oatmeal with honey touches . They came as a surprise for me , as i ' m used to eat the generic energetic bars from the vending machine at work , that usually taste like cardboard and corn syrup . These aren ' t like that . They are sweet but not overwhelmingly so , with the taste of honey being very perceptible . The bars aren ' t " honey golden " in color as many supposedly honey products tend to be nowadays , but I see that as a good thing , because that color usually comes from caramel and burned sugar , not honey .

These are hands down the best gummis I have ever tasted . It may take a minute to get used to the flavors , only because they are so authentically fruity , they don ' t taste like the overly sweet gummis you are probably used to , but they are definitely worth a try . These are different then the original German version of Goldbaren , these are the Saft ( translated as " juice " in English ) bears .

We ' re fans of the " brown lid , " natural - style , peanut butters . and Skippy doesn ' t disappoint . The peanut flavor is strong , there ' s no oil separation ( so no stirring is necessary ) and the texture is very creamy / smooth . As far as differences between this and the " natural " offerings of other brands , as long as we stick with the creamy variety my kids can ' t tell a difference . so we don ' t mind changing it up with whatever is on sale .

I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth .

These pops were absolutely awful . My first try was the German Chocolate Cake , which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy .

We sent this selection of Six Mackinac " Fudge Slices " to my daughter ' s college dorm as a bit of comfort food at the start of the new semester .

The shipping from Mackinac was exceptionally fast with the fudge arriving well ahead of the estimated delivery date . Highly Recommended !

My daughter eats one of these bars almost every day . She had to go gluten - free last year and this was the first treat we found that she really liked .

This blend is delicious . It ' s so flavorful that no one who tries it seems to notice that it ' s salt - free .

One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'negative']]

I was pretty pleased when I tried this item after a recent food service show . There is a very strong chocolate smell and taste . One bar has 150 calories ( 30 from fat ) and 9 grams of sugar ( versus 16 in the old Cocoa puffs cereal and milk bars ) . The texture is different , it looks more like cocoa krispies than puffs and my jaw hurt from chewing so much but overall it is a nice option for people ( especially kids ) who don ' t have time to have a sit - down breakfast in the morning . i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'neutral']]
These cookies taste fresh and sugary sweet , with ` gooey ' chocolate chips , and a ` chewy , ' but cake - like cookie dough texture . There is a firm flavor of vanilla in these cookies , making for a nice contrast with the fudge flavor of the chocolate chips . At 150 calories for two cookies , you ' ll want to pace yourself , or alternatively , buy lots of bags of these bad buys . They taste great with a glass of milk as an afternoon snack . They also taste great with a glass of milk as a morning snack . As an evening snack . . .####[['food quality', 'positive']]

Excellent , simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised . I consider it to be a medium roast / breakfast blend kind of coffee . If you are into heavy , dark roasts like French , Italian , or Sumatran , then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste . However , I love it . Unfortunately , the one - star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee . don ' t follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you ' ll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this " soup " tolerable . i didn ' t fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price . not even close .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'conflict']]

Everytime I run out and get regular kibble or cans , my cats look scruffy and they seem to hate the store - bought stuff and hate me for feeding it to them . On this food for years , my cats are shiny , never gassy , never fat though I leave the food out all the time in a bistro feeder , and their poop ain ' t sweet but seems less foul than when on other food . Only down side is that you have to remember to reorder it 2 weeks before you run out because it ' s not in any stores . It ' s not cheap but with 2 cats a 40 pound bag ( $ 90 including shipping ) lasts me about 12 weeks , so under $ 4 a week per cat , maybe $ 2 more than Purina , $ 1 more than Iams and about the same as Blue or Nutro .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]

If you ' re ever in the need for an exotic alternative , in your regular soup routine , then try Nile Spice soups . Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry , turmeric , and other East / West Indian spices . Although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true Indian ( or Caribbean ) curry dish , the soup is still a delicious meal . As a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate ( MSG ) , I am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive . The soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at 30 % ; however , most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile . Try the Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup today and be whisked away into a unique aroma from half way around the world .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

The blueberry is very tasty but watch out when you open a bottle . We have now had 3 bottles that were bad .

It ' s difficult to find Bob ' s Red Mill Light Spelt Flour in my area , so I have this product auto - shipped to my home , and use it just as I would wheat flour in most recipes . Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat , although it doesn ' t work for anyone with celiac - sprue disease . Because this flour does contain some of the whole grain , the products I bake with it are a little darker in color and slightly coarser in texture than something that is made with all - purpose white wheat flour , but we haven ' t found the differences to be objectionable .

We had high hopes for this product and when we sprayed it on it was so noxious to us that we thought that it would be effective . However , within seconds ( it was not even dry yet ) the squirrels were back and it had absolutely no effect on them . We stood and watched as 3 squirrels descended up on the bird feeder and began eating , soon even more squirrels arrived and stood on the top of the feeder what was still glistening with the product .

I cook my oats in a crockpot overnight . I throw in cinnamon , diced apples and a little organic raw apple juice in place of 50 % of the water . Between the apples and apple juice the oatmeal needs no additional sugar and my house smells amazing in the morning when we all wake up ! Love Scottish Oats !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

These brown rice bowls are perfect for long - term storage in your pantry - no refrigeration required ! The rice itself is very good , indestinguishable from rice I would cook myself .

Like the first reviewer , I too was surprised to get a box ( no inner box at all ) of loose k cups . There was a cardboard tube in the middle of the box to keep them from rolling around too much , but one was wrinkled so badly it almost fell apart . This is a nice assortment and you can compare different brands of the same flavors for your reference . But the package and presentation is low budget . Also no poster as described . Rating it a 4 for coffee assortment but a 0 for packaging and product misrepresentation !####[['shipment quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I have tried several Dr . McDougall ' s Vegan soups with three different microwaves . The time needed in each has been quite different - from needing less ( to avoid boiling over ) to needing more . The soup should to be very hot but not hot enough to boil over . I believe many complaints of " chewy " pasta / noodles / veggies is probably from unwillingness to experiment with cooking and standing times .####[['food general', 'positive']]
I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years . PB2 isn ' t a perfect replacement for peanut butter  but it has a natural taste to it , is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile . I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product . When turning PB2 into peanut butter , don ' t add too much water , or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted . In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread , I also put PB2 powder in smoothies , on cereal and with oatmeal .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
This is definitely the best flavor of coffee that my wife and I have tried so far on our new Keurig . Not too bold , not too weak . The decaf version is great too for those late night drinks .

I ' ve had great success using the pill pockets with my dog . I ' ve always used the tablet size before , but on a whim bought the capsule version ( same price ) . The capsule pill pockets are so large , you can easily split them in in half ( even if you ' re trying to hide capsule - sized pills ) . If you have tablet pills , I ' d bet you could use one capsule - size pill pocket for every 3 - 4 pills . I will not waste money again on the tablet version of this product !

We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today . I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature ( I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6 - 9 seconds ) and taste ok . When I tasted this , I made a face because it was so yucky ! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon . To her credit , my ( 8 month old ) daughter ate some bites , but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors . I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]

I assumed that the description of 9 pound box of assorted coffee beans referred to the weight of the coffee . It does not .

Regardless as to how good or bad the food items are I don ' t consider this to be a ' gift box ' as a 4x7 inch non - removable shipping label was slapped on top of the box .

These are the best sugar free coffee syrups on the planet . If you want a great intro pack , this mix works . They also work for Italian sodas . My favorites are chocolate ( not like a Hershey ' s at all , they stir in to the coffee ) , hazlenut ( has a good , nutty flavor , can turn any trash cup of Maxwell House from an uncleaned urn into a gormet experience , and raspberry ( also good on ice cream , of course ) .

I placed the order based on the good reviews here . Generally speaking , I like it especially the texture . It contains the right amount of moisture , not to dry , not to moist . However , I do believe it contains too much almond extract . It ' s too dominant in the smell and in the taste . It ' s hard to miss once you open the plastic wrap of the bar . these beans came FAST ! not to mention as soon as i got the package ( packaged very well ) and opened it up . you could smell nothing but awesome vanilla aroma . inspecting the beans through the resealable plastic vaccume packed bag they appear to be long , plump and in good condition . cant wait to use these !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment delivery', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

A year or so ago , I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten - free .

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better . Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2 % milk is required even to get a child to drink them . My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best . Avoid if possible , but not a total waste . Consider my 2 stars as " generous .

These little chocolates are just what the product name says they are , nibbles of Cadbury chocolate with creamy caramel inside .

This stuff tastes like mushrooms to me and I hate mushrooms ( partially allergic ) .

We should only " feed " our skin what we would put in our mouths ! exactly what i wanted . looks great and have had many nice compliments on it .

I love this coconut water - - it ' s naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water ( but not too much ) . My only " complaint " is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $ 22 - 23 on Amazon a few months ago , signing up for the regular delivery . Now , it is listed as " not available " for the regular delivery , but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $ 38 ( also a 12 - pack , same brand , same size per can ) .

We drink a lot of tea in our household - black , green , white and a variety of herbal . This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart ( where it sells for about $ 2 a box ; it sells for around $ 4 at our local grocery store . ) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh . We enjoy this tea with Splenda and sometimes with lemon for extra flavor .

I must say I was quite disappointed in this product and will not order it again . I had purchased this product a few years ago and remembered it being so full bodied , flavorful and just perfect in every respect . It was like drinking a perfect cup of hot chocolate .

Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried , these by far are the best . They are close to the real thing as I recall . Sometimes they are difficult to obtain .

I bought Halo because I was looking for a healthy way to help me transition my 3 cats from dry food to canned . My cats were kibble addicts , which the vet said was bad for them , and I wasn ' t having much luck trying to entice them to switch to canned food . I bought Halo chicken and I crumbled some over the canned food and my cats started gobbling it up . It is a little pricey but I like that it is purely dehydrated chicken with no additives .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
After reading the other review for this wonderful cat food , I wondered why the previous reviwer had decided to give it less than 5 stars ? She mentioned that her cat didn ' t care for the salmon in it , however , the concept of the food is excellent . Well , yes , I agree , although , I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating . My cats , all 5 of them , love all the flavors of this brand . And they are very finicky too . I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
This is my favorite of all the Sparkling Ice flavors . Please see my complete review of it beside the 32 - ounce bottle , where I accidentally posted it . I ' d definitely stay with the 17 - ounce size because it ' s fun to drink out of that perfectly shaped bottle , and I wouldn ' t want to dilute the delicious , authentic flavor with ice . Since I posted that review my husband and I , in fear of running out of the stuff without access to it locally , have begun to receive the Pink Grapefruit , Orange Mango , and Black Raspberry by subscription , twice a month , and the shipping cartons are starting to loom .

I cooked noodle soups using the chicken soup as the base . The chicken soup turned out to be a little salty . I added noodles and vegetables into the soup without adding extra salt .

Our cat doesn ' t like the feline Pill Pockets so much , but he loves these canine beef ones .

I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten - free diet . They taste great !

VIA Italian Roast tastes burnt .

I have ordered this stuff numerous times now and I haven ' t been disappointed . It is a bit on the pricey side , but I try not to use it all the time .

If your dog isn ' t a chewer / destroyer - of - toys like mine , this might be fine . But my lab destroyed the rope and ate the plastic stopper very quickly .

I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas . This one had a very strong , very strange flavor . It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea . I think another reviewer who described it as a " burnt " flavor may have gotten it right . I tried it once , and immediately switched back to Twinings . I recently tried a second bag , thinking maybe I overreacted the first time , but had to pour it away .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet . I also like to buy from reputable companies . So it is hard to find products that meet my criteria .

The malt vinegar gives it a slight and I mean slight sweetness to the vinegar taste . These are amazing . Crunchy , thick , just the right amount of sea salt .

This is an excellent dog food . When I switched my Labradoodle puppy over to Orijen she had no problem whatsoever digesting it . It is difficult to find this dog food at pet stores in my area .

Torani Sugar Free Raspberry Syrup is a great tasting , diabetic friendly flavoring . This syrup has a subtle and natural raspberry flavor that goes great in ice tea or mixed with club soda .

Petite Cuisine Gourmet Cat Food was a real hit with my impossible cat . My cat refuses almost all canned cat food so I was completely shocked when she showed an interest in this food .

My husband loved this for Christmas . He loves to grill and loves his seasonings . We just recently started by sea salt versus regular salt and really like the way it seasons food more thoroughly .

If you are all about eating salt covered chips , you ' ll be OK . For people who don ' t like the taste of salt poured in their mouth . Might want to move on .

I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty . If you use the recommended 8oz setting , it has a full enough flavor . My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener .

I cannot say I had high expectations for a low - acid French roast coffee . It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full - bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee .

I ' ve tried many green teas in the same price range , but I always come back to Stash Organic Green . This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste . It ' s light , vegetal and very smooth . To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas , and make sure the water temperature doesn ' t go over 180 degrees . I often mix this tea with cascade mint , jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it ' s very good by itself , plain green tea can get boring day - after - day .

Like others , I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it . I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine , my dog LOVED them like always ! When I went to re - order , I read the review about the treats now being " basted " with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird , because my order was the same . That is , until I received this last order of 4 packs this week . All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor - - my dog , who was usually so excited to get one of these treats , left it on the floor untouched .

I won ' t bore you with stats about salt , the good bad or ugly . Yes , you are supposed to take it in moderation , so when you do salt your food , it should be done with this salt .

In researching dandelion root , I came across a lot of different , sometimes contradictory claims , none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research . I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect , and it is supposedly good for the liver . Again , those claims may be dubious , but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason ( caffeine , acid ) . It tasted terrible to me at first , but after about 4 cups I really started to like it . I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes . Now it basically tastes like coffee to me ( note that I ' m more of a tea drinker , however ) .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end . So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed . As you can tell , I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand - - perfect for a northeast winter ' s day !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

If only the jar inside were not plastic , which makes me nervous , especially with boiling water potentially leaching toxic compounds . But a quart glass jar will break from the shock of the difference between the cold contents and boiling water . If you try to use warm water to prevent the glass from breaking , warm , 95 F water added to the starter causes it to gel into lumps . This will help prevent the jar from breaking , and the yogurt turns out okay , but after that , when you transfer a quarter cup for the next batch and add milk , you ' d better not heat the milk up too hot , keep an eye on it . One of the reasons I bought this yogurt maker was that it was less of a hassle and used less energy , but the workaround to avoid the plastic container is a bit annoying .

Well , yes , of course we would only use them with supervision , but I shouldn ' t have to expect to scoop them out of my son ' s mouth to prevent him from choking . My husband will eat the rest as a snack and we will never purchase them again .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['shipment quality', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

This is a very pleasant tasting Dragon Well tea .

Cliff Bar White Chocolate Macademia Nut Granola Bars are BY FAR the most delicious granola bars I have ever tasted .

Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies . If you ' re going to give your child cookies , these are not so bad healthwise . However , the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving , when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each . That ' s a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child , I think . I buy snack packs so that when I ' m on the go , I can open a bag and hand it to my kid . I don ' t feel that I can do that with these .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies , some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags . The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent / normal size but they really are a bit smaller . Case they are shipped in is great for storage , in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase . Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though . . . unless you like dark , crumby hard ones .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['shipment quality', 'positive']]
I ' m not familiar with the benefits of high pH water like this but if it ' s better for you than normal water then I ' d highly recommend this product because it tastes EXACTLY like regular filtered , bottled water . Some people have talked about different aftertastes or flavors but to me it tastes the same as other bottled waters , even when drunk back to back . If this is healthier than just drinking water it ' s a great option - no calories , no added ingredients to give flavor , etc . Basically just water with hidden health benefits .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

When i initially purchased this item for my dog , i was a bit nervous . I had given her the food ( and had slightly heated it up ) and she smelled it and walked away .

The cure taste is too strong . The instructions they have can ' t be correct . I ' ve only tried it with cut meat , no ground . I let it marinade for about a day and a half .

Even though I opted out of recieving " email reminders " to leave feedback / reviews I just received one from this company , so here ' s my review : I ' ve already left a review for the SodaStream machine , and it is not complimentary due to the monopoly on the CO2 . Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews . It is unprofessional .

I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint . It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars .

The aroma was amazing but it just tasted like regular coffee . The coffee was good , it just did not have the flavor I was expecting .

This was my first wine kit , it was easy to understand and easy to use . I am about one more week from completing it so I cannot yet comment on the taste . I have to admit before I bought this kit  i didn ' t realize you also need to purchase all of the necessary wine making equipment . I really like the fact that the kit includes all the ingredients for the wine in addition to the corks , labels , and sleeves for the bottle necks so that the finished product looks very professional and can be given as gifts , some of the more expensive wine kits from other manufacturers do not include those extra items .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture . This is one of my favorite foods ever , and the lingering memory I have of Brazil . Fluffy , moist and made out of Tapioca flour , these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread - - seriously they aren ' t ! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven , and they ' re just as fabulous cold . Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix , and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy , delicious treat or side dish . They never turn out wrong .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Without a doubt , this is hands down the best coconut water product I ' ve tried .

My husband and I travel for several weeks a year in an RV , and always take " instant " and " single cup " brews along with us . I have taken both Maxwell House and Folgers " brew in the cup " coffee bags , and found them acceptable ( in lieu of a fresh cup of coffee from an actual coffee pot ) , so my expectations were that this coffee would be similar in taste and quality . I was wrong . I thought this was an exceptionally tasty cup of coffee - on par with coffee that has been brewed in a coffee maker . It is smooth and flavorful , with a very fresh taste . I highly recommend it for those who want a good cup of coffee without committing to a whole pot - or to lugging a K - cup type brewer along to work or on the road .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
These are tasty in a serious junk food kind of way , but that is not a surprise since this is candy melted onto corn chips : You eat these when you are craving salt and sugar and can ' t be bothered to pour a bag of M & Ms into a bowl of salted popcorn .

It ' s hard to explain what this Bonito del Norte tuna is like to people that can only relate to the canned tuna commonly found in grocery stores in America . It really is a completely different type of food . Delicate , tasteful , and healthy ! You are probably used to mixing your tuna with mayonnaise or some other thing to make it palatable , but it would be a shame to do that with this tuna , because it is truly a pleasure to eat on its own on crispy french bread .

This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely . When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha , I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves . It wasn ' t unpleasant , just totally unexpected . The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste , where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor . The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor , and I can ' t help but wonder if the spiciness isn ' t at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground . Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

We have two Siberian Huskies and the oldest has to take medication every night . She hates the way it smells and will dig it out of anything else we try to hide it in - even cake .

Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors . I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I really liked the taste of this drink - it reminded me of a cherry soda . There was no aftertaste and it did seem to give me more energy to get through the part of the day that just drags on . I also thought it worked fairly quickly . I was a bit surprised to discover that each can actually contains 2 servings , at approximately 130 calories each , so it ' s definitely not a diet - friendly drink . Although I think the drink did provide more of a boost than a diet soda , for me , it ' s just not worth the extra calories on a regular basis .

If you ' re looking for the tea served on ice with condensed milk or hot at your favorite Thai restaurant , this is it ! The package says to use 4 tablespoons of tea per cup and strain - so I bought this 4 - pack ( figuring that 4T per cup would use up the stuff pretty fast ) . I think that ratio is way too much . I use about 3 tablespoons in my 1 liter French press , and it comes out great . Just pour the water over the tea , stir a few times while letting it steep and serve . Enjoy ! - Charlie####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it , I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come . Unfortunately for me , the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly . But I stuck with it , started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production . While I ' m sure it works for some , if you ' re just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with I don ' t think taking this will increase your supply much if at all . But if you think you ' d like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you !####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
We get Nutiva Organic EV coconut oil on a two month subscription . It ' s great . I like to mix a serving of pistachios , a serving of almonds , and a tbsp of oil together for a late evening treat . My wife makes a great low carb snack by heating equal parts oil , semisweet chocolate chips , and chopped nuts ; puts them in cupcake molds and freezes . Delicious but remember coconut oil melts easily ( I just pop the whole thing in my mouth ) .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'neutral']]
I am a big fan of Cooking Light magazine . They regularly feature recipes using Israeli Couscous . I found it once at a local health food store , but it turned out that they had purchased it my mistake . I have driven 45 miles to the next biggest town to find it - even at specialty stores - and it is still pretty rare in these parts . I buy several bags from Amazon at a time and keep them stored in rugged plastic containers .

My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products . It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations . My vet prescribed a dog food that is only available from vets but after 3 months I saw no improvement . Finally I researched on my own and tried Wellness Simple Solutions and after 3 months I noticed that her ear problems subsided . I supplement her evening meals with the Wellness Simple Solutions canned food and she loves it . Compared with the stuff the vet prescribed , this is working out much better . my friends and i really enjoy this . 4 minutes in a 700 microwave and almost all the kernals pop . nice flavor . not too much salt . 270 calories per beg . what more could you want .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

This rice is a nice change from the traditional white rice I find in the local grocery , primarily because it ' s sticky . When reheated it tastes as good as it did when first prepared .

It still seems freshly cooked 3 days later .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I love the Chocolate Mint and Peanut butter flavors , but this flavor tasted like vanilla whey .

Mostly , this was good stuff . I haven ' t had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some . Most of the jerky was good , but I ran into 1 too many pieces that was fatty or felt like a salty chunk of fat .

I am torn : 4 stars or 5 stars ? I decided on 5 stars : - The taste is great ! If you are Coke or Pepsi drinker , then they may not be sweet enough for you . I am not , hence I and my entire family enjoyed their subtle chocolaty flavor . The nutritional content is not bad at all , except artificial flavoring , which I would never notice on my taste buds if it was not written .

This gift was a big hit . It has a cool look to the product as well as the actual tea . The shipping box arrived in a little bit of a beaten up state , but the glass pot was packaged very well and was in perfect condition .

I really like tacos and Spanish rice . Problem is if I use the taco seasoning pack and rice seasoning pack , it ends being a gazillion mg of sodium .

I ' ve tried these before individually , but this was the first opportunity I had to get them together . First , the food is relatively good quality for this kind of product , but I would say that it ' s more oily than what you ' d find in a restaurant ( and definitely moreso than homecooked ) and of course significantly higher in sodium . The taste , however , is reasonably good . Second , the price that I paid for these was very good ( I ended up getting a 20 % discount ) , and so from a value perspective I would say decently good food + good price = very good value .####[['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I wish it was a little more affordable ( because I have to use more of it than the average person ) but I do plan to buy it again whenever possible .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink . To my taste buds , this does not taste rich and chocolate - y despite its name of " Double Chocolate Meltdown " . But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose , it is the best hot chocolate powder around . I ' ve tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee . It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee , and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation . Love it for that !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

I have been buying these for years from Walmart and Sam ' s , but this is the best price I have found so far .

These bones are my dog ' s absolute favorite . He is a SUPER strong chewer , although he only weighs about 60 lbs and is otherwise completely gentle . It ' s sometimes hard to find bones and toys for him since he always chews them to bits within 5 minutes . These bones last him forever , at least 3 - 4 months at a time . He loves the filling and will lick it for hours . Would recommend these bones to any large dog owner .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Flamin ' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites . The meat is tender , and the taste ( based on the ones I ' ve bought ) are extreme with flavor .

Don ' t bother buying a Senseo coffee maker . The coffee is delicious and a cup is brewed very quickly , IF YOU CAN BUY THE COFFEE PODS . No other brand tastes as good .

My whole family gobbles this up - do not be afraid to cook longer than the box says to get the noodles nice and tender . Then I always pour the cooked noodles into a strainer in the sink and rinse all the " sludge " ( from the brown rice ) with cold water . Then I warm it back up in the pan , usally adding some sour cream , butter , & salt / pepper to the sauce mix . As a former lover of all things gluten - containing , I have to say that when the rice pasta is rinsed , I think it ' s just as good if not better than traditional wheat pasta . Shocking " the pasta with cold water makes all the difference in the world ! Hope this helps .####[['food general', 'positive']]
Bought this at Ralphs , 1 for $ 4 . 49 to try and was unimpressed . The high protein is great , but you can find that in other grocery store products . The high fiber is great for diets , and you can ' t find this high in any other pasta , but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids . It definitely tastes and feels better than some " healthy " pastas available , but I ' m just not sold on this .

100 % Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers . This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes . The pods work well , as intended , and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity . The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use . I have since tried several of their different coffees , and yet this remains my favorite ! litly carbonated yet sweet not to sweet it does really taste like lime and it is a very good soda i love limes and 7up and ramune a japenese soda . if you like any of those u will love this stuff but dont buy it on amazon buy it at smith which sels them for 89 . c you have to use a bottle opener to open them enjoy####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'negative']]

The packaging is great for a gift . The teabags are pyramidal in shape . As far as taste , if you ' re just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla , then this Tazo brand will do it for you . If you ' re looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste , then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea , Tazo , will disappoint you . The raw rooibos taste , without these " improvements " such as vanilla , is full - bodied and has its own unique taste . I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings , Republic of Tea , and Numi .####[['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

Great tasting organic product ! I have been on a somewhat organic diet since I was a child . My parents always had an organic garden and now I have one .

. . but the product photo threw me off a little . For some reason I was thinking the 3 pounds were being shipped in ( 6 ) 1 / 2 pound bags . Anyway , totally an assumption and goof - up on my part . I ' m leaning towards using all liquid malt extract going forward though . I can get 6 pounds ( just the right amount for a 5 - 6 gallon batch ) shipped to my house for about $ 16 .

When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts ! It is really wonderful and my go - to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve ( sometimes several as I give them away ) .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I guess I had no idea how good the goji berries were from Whole Foods until I tried these .

Very excited to order these . . . but what a disgusting rip - off . I echo the sentiments of those who compared this to the stuff you get at truck stops - overly sweet and a bit oily . plus it is simply powdered mix in your k - cup . . . if you want this taste ( probably a bit better ) for like 25 % of the cost buy some instant mix at your grocery store and run your Keuring with no k cup and stir .####[['food general', 'positive']]

I have sampled many bulk Chai teas and I have to say this is the BEST one ever . It is very authentic and hits a lot of flavor notes .

Buying K - Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have . People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup - count .

This is by far the best GF sandwich bread I ' ve tried yet , Whole Foods makes a good one as well but for the price GF Pantry is much better . It actually tasted like white bread . It was moist and fluffy . Cut it thin because it is really filling . PS Pamelas GF bread mix was strange , very dense and tasted like bisquits , and Bobs Red Mill stinks of Garbanzo bean flour####[['food prices', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'neutral']]
Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company .

We ' ll buy more of these !####[['food general', 'positive']]
I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe . Whenever I put it out at feeding time , there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot ' s Stew in them . With 5 kitty mouths to feed , the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot ' s Stew , so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied . Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting , those poor things that had to " settle " for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew . I have been so pleased with it , that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners . But , at our house , WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
These taste excellent straight out of the can on gluten free crackers . Excellent source of protein , too ! I purchased several types of this brand at the store to sample them before I purchased them in bulk on Amazon - glad I did ! This one is my favorite .

Mine wasn ' t in pieces as another reviewer stated .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
Dude , they ' re Reese ' s Cups . If you need to read a review that probably means you ' ve never had one .

This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store , so I bought it online . Reading about possible ways to off - set liver damage 2 / 2 medications ( statins in particular ) , I figured , why not - - I drink tea , so I can try this one . It tastes ok . Not great .

Great cereal that for some reason is unavailable in any grocery stores in our area ! Kelloggs has not been helpful when I question them about why ! So I was very excited when I found it on Amazon !

I didn ' t look carefully at the ingredient list before I ordered these treats . They contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back . They are a hard , crunchy treat so your dog will have to use the back molars to chew them where it would be easy to get a cavity . While they smelled great and have some quality ingredients in them , for me it just wasn ' t worth taking that chance when there are lots of other great dog treats out there , where I won ' t have this worry , to get instead .####[['food quality', 'negative']]
This completely reminds me of Kool - Aid . Pretty sweet , no particular green tea taste . I appreciate that I can have something this sweet and refreshing without a ton of calories or caffeine . The granules take forever to dissolve so it is best used in a water bottle you can shake rather than a glass you have to stir . I notice they ' ve added a pitcher sized pack to the single serve lines which I assume would be more cost effective .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
I bought this chutney to make a recipe from a magazine I was reading .

I eat a teaspoon of coconut oil at night to maintain regularity . I ' ve also found that certain foods taste better when cooking in coconut oil .

My dog has had some skin issues ( about a month after we adopted him we found out that he has mange ) , and his coat wasn ' t looking very nice .

Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added . Was quite disappointed to learn that 12 egg whites are also needed . This results in a lot of egg yolks which need to be used in another recipe or pitched . If that many eggs are needed , I might as well make the cake from scratch . No need for a mix . As a side note , the cake mix did perform well and produce a good angel food cake .####[['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I was hesitant to buy the babycook simply because it was yet another gadget . But it has been a lifesaver . I have 9 month old twins and make their food .

I grabbed a variety of various protein / energy bars , including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt . The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides . The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing , unfortunately . Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful , but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one .

Oatmeal Squares is in about the largest print you can fit on the Box . When you read the ingredients , the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour . So how can it rightfully be called a " Crunchy Oat Cereal " .

Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]

If my dog likes something , he wolfs it down fast and if he doesn ' t , he ' ll give it a sniff and walk away . He really liked Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food . The bits that are shaped and formed to look like roast beef are slightly soft and chewy and the hard bits of kibble are dyed , which seems unnecessary . The first ingredient is beef , but there are a lot of filler ingredients as well , including " animal digest " and " poultry by - product meal " . Google those terms if you want grossed out . It ' s probably a decent dog food for the price , but if I continue to feed it to my dog , I will supplement with fresh meats , fruits and vegetables .####[['food prices', 'positive']]

These are very good tasting and when I gave a few to my baby he loved them !

This is good coffee . I think it is just short of 5 - start rating . The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast .

This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle - brand jalapeno chips . At the time I placed my order , I couldn ' t remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked , and the Kettle - brand chips were packaged in a similarly - colored bag .

When I run out ( probably sometime next year ! ) , I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle - brand chips .

We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food . Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we ' ve had them on .

This is an excellent , cost - effective alternative to Red Bull . The flavor is spot on - - even though a purist may be able to notice the difference , I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal ! For the price , two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this . Also , with this syrup , you have the option to how strong or weak you ' d like to make each serving . I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further .

If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies , and have grown up eating that style of gummy , you will probably be disappointed with these . These are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands , as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo . You get roughly twice as many pounds for the price , which is a big plus . A big downside for adults is that the blue / purple colors turn your tongue blue , and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush . The Haribo ' s don ' t have that side effect . As far as the fancy flavors go , that is just clever marketing as opposed to an actually benefit since none of the flavors taste as good as any of the basic Harbio flavors , in my opinion .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

This olive oil so far is great . I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet . However , it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill . As for the taste , it is very light and a bit nutty .

The previous review , faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness , is accurate , and I was at first equally disappointed . But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice , much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it . This works !

The product quality is great , but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D ' Oro brand due to the ongoing strike .

Oh my gosh , these are gross . I bought them because of Hungry Girl ' s glowing recommendation . and I gotta say she steered me wrong this time . These are SUPER salty , and they taste like what I imagine dog kibbles would taste like .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I had stumbled upon these at our local food store and was amazed at how good they were . All three of my kids went nuts over them . Plus for me they are only 70 calories per bag . They are good plain and would be awesome in salads . Well worth it I will order again####[['food general', 'positive']]
Kix cereal is absolutely delicious . Here , you are getting 6 boxes of it . I imagine that after consuming 6 boxes of Kix , they may not seem quite as scrumptious , so maybe it would be wise to give a box or two away so you do not get burned out on eating them . Recommended accessories : - Bowl - Milk - Spoon####[['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food general', 'neutral']]
I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor , all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste . I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips . Also , the companion pump didn ' t keep it ' s prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to " measure " easily . 1 pump , 1 / 2 pump , etc ) One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant , and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
I ' m surprised Haribo allows their name on this product . It ' s nothing like their more traditional fare ( Golden Bears and the like ) . It ' s something that I would expect to see from Brach ' s . I won ' t eat it ( and neither will my grandkids ) . As it ' s said , live and learn .####[['food general', 'negative']]
Was told by an employee in a pet store that this brand is one of the best . Bought from them and then purchased at Amazon ( cheaper ) . My dog wasn ' t to happy with the beef selections . After reading the label , realized it was processed in Thailand . Only gave my dog a few cans and then threw away the rest .####[['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]
I recently bought the Abuelita tablets just to try them . I am a big chocolate fan and love to try anything that includes chocolate . I was very surprised at how wonderful it tasted . Now I cant stop drinking it . It is great as a treat throughout the day or before bed . I would highly recommend this drink and suggest that anyone try it .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
Maybe I received the expired batch from five years ago , but this stuff is tasteless . It takes two K - cups to make a normal strength cup of decaf . I wonder if Emeril samples the products that bear his name ? I will avoid his picture from now on ! Timothy ' s decaf is just great I ' ll stick with that I guess .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
This kit really does include everything you need to go from never making sushi to being confident . The book , along with a few youtube videos , are the only training I got in how to make sushi and it has been an enjoyable process . We have used all the ingredients by now , but still use the mat , spoon and book to refer back to from time to time . Great set####[['food general', 'positive']]
I love chocolate . Good chocolate . I ' ve tried fancy bars , local bars , hand - poured bars , organic bars , and almost everything else , and THIS is my favorite . The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter , the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight ( very slight ) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine , and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly . If only they sold it in more places !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
As claimed in ads this corn is for added flavoring such as caramel . If purchased for popping and eating ' as - is ' you ' ll discover wonderfully huge corn puffs with NO TASTE . The ads are correct , buy to flavor or not I ' m not intentionally criticizing this corn , the mistake I made was assuming it would taste as great as it looks , without caramel .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I am a huge fan of these . I first tried them out after seeing them at a local grocer , and quickly found that was addicted ! they are seriously that yummy . My kids always beg me for some , too . Amazon doesn ' t have the best price , though , try a local big box store for the best price . Just be careful not to eat too many !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'negative']]
I ' ve been buying these cookies for the last five years . I used to purchase them through a local store , but after moving to Texas I wasn ' t able to find them . So I purchased them through Amazon and let me tell you this is the ONLY way I ' ll ever buy these again . They were fresh , they were good , and they were packaged perfectly .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'positive']]
The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat . This was a big turn - off , but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past , so I gave it a shot . The flavor is nice , and has a decent aftertaste . The texture is OK , but not what I would expect from a " jerky " . . I would have preferred something much chewier . I did eat them , but it ' s not something I will purchase again .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
I have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease for eight years now , and this is the first product I have found that actually replaces flour . I have been able to make ANY recipe using this product as a 1 : 1 replacement and it works , and more importantly , tastes , GREAT ! ! Purchasing it here at Amazon is much cheaper than the health food stores , too . For those of you who have been gluten free for a long time , I might caution you to take it easy when introducing this product to your diet . If you are like me , you ' ve just done without a lot of grains , and your system will need some adjustment time .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]

Both of my English Bulldogs love them ! ! They are a great size for training , however they are a little more chewy than I thought they would be . The 1 lb . bag is a great size and a great value .

Not much to say that hasn ' t been said before about the Carbon ' s Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix . I had been using the regular mix for both waffles and pancakes with outstanding results , and then I stumbled upon the All Natural mix . I am frankly not sure what the main differences are between the regular mix and the all natural mix , but with kids around the house , it seemed like a no - brainer to be using the All Natural . The waffles and pancakes are still amazing with the All Natural , and I still get requests all the time from my kids for " Daddy ' s Waffles " and " Daddy ' s Pancakes " . Needless to say , I ' ll be sticking with Carbon ' s over any other mix , and I ' ll be sticking with the All Natural .####[['food general', 'positive']]
For me , it ' s great being able to buy natural treats for my dog that also taste great . My dog loves these ( and I like them , too ) . I ' ve made dog biscuits before , but it ' s convenient to be able to pick some up at the store . I ' ve tried a number of natural biscuits , some good , some horrible . These are great . I ' ve never bought them in bulk from Amazon , but the biscuits are inside of a sealed plastic bag within the box , so I ' d guess that they would stay fresh for a while . i have to say i was not pleased with the product apon arrival . it was not even in any type of box . . just wrapped in a bag . . the product itself had scratches on the plastic and seemed like cheap plastic . im surely not pleased with the price i payed for it####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'negative'], ['shipment prices', 'negative']]
Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock . Ours was actually 15 + years old when we opened it , and it was deliciously smooth , with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel . Kick was in the mid - palette , clean finish . I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap . I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up , so if you have a couple of whiskey stones , I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping . More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don ' t have stones would be a travesty - this is some really , really good bourbon .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I really enjoy this coffee . the flavor is very good ! ! However , every bag I have used has at least one pod that is ripped . The coffee is loose in the bag and the pod is empty . it ' s a real mess and very annoying ! I think they need better quality control .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
