This review is some research about whether or not this product is actually rapadura .####[]
Although this product is indexed under " rapadura , " which is a Portuguese name for dried sugar cane juice , this company ( Rapunzel ) used to sell a product that is specifically labeled " Rapadura " ( see below ; also Google " rapadura " for more info ) .####[]
In researching whole cane sugar , brown sugar , and sugarcane , etc . , on Wikipedia , " rapadura " is the name used in Brazil , Argentina , some other South and Latin American countries and the Caribbean , whereas " panela " is used in Columbia , " piloncillo " is used in Mexico , and " jaggery " is used in India for what appears to be identical products - - unrefined , dried , natural sugar from sugar cane , minimally processed , with all the natural vitamins and minerals still intact .####[]
From the pictures I ' ve seen on Wikipedia and other websites , " organic cane sugar " is quite a bit lighter in color than rapadura , panela , jaggery , etc . , suggesting that is has be refined to some degree , like adding calcium carbonate to remove some so - called impurities .####[]
From Wikipedia entry for " Rapadura : " " Despite the fact that rapadura is a very old foodstuff , predating even the colonization of Brazil , a German company called Rapunzel has registered the name as a German trade mark DE 1143537 , an event that has greatly angered Brazilians , as they see the name as a generic all - purpose word , like ' lemonade ' or ' sandwich ' .####[]
As of February 2009 , Rapunzel has removed the Rapadura name from their unrefined and unbleached whole cane sugar product sold in health food stores , though their website has not yet been updated to reflect this . "####[]

I ' ve tried a number of natural biscuits , some good , some horrible .####[]
These are great .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'great']]
I ' ve never bought them in bulk from Amazon , but the biscuits are inside of a sealed plastic bag within the box , so I ' d guess that they would stay fresh for a while .####[['biscuits are inside of a sealed plastic bag within the box', 'food general', 'positive', "I ' d guess that they would stay fresh"]]
i have to say i was not pleased with the product apon arrival . it was not even in any type of box . . just wrapped in a bag . . the product itself had scratches on the plastic and seemed like cheap plastic . im surely not pleased with the price i payed for it####[['product', 'shipment quality', 'negative', 'not pleased'], ['NULL', 'shipment prices', 'negative', 'surely not pleased'], ['product', 'shipment quality', 'positive', 'had scratches'], ['plastic', 'shipment quality', 'negative', 'seemed like cheap']]
This is a great shampoo it is helping keep my hair in better shape while I am trying to grow it longer .####[]
I have had less breakage and my hair is fuller looking and soft .####[]
The texture of the shampoo itself is thick and has luxurious lather .####[]
I would honestly compare this to salon quality product .####[]
I have the conditioner as well which I do not need to use daily as the shampoo is moisturizing enough for my hair .####[]
I don ' t know if it is actually promoting growth but it feels good whatever it ' s doing !####[]
Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock .####[]
Ours was actually 15 + years old when we opened it , and it was deliciously smooth , with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'deliciously smooth'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'lot of warmth'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'great mouth feel']]
Kick was in the mid - palette , clean finish .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'mid - palette'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'clean finish']]
I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'very impressed'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'smooth'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'makes Rare Breed seem cheap']]
I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up , so if you have a couple of whiskey stones , I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'NULL']]
More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don ' t have stones would be a travesty - this is some really , really good bourbon .####[['bourbon', 'food general', 'positive', 'really , really good']]
I really enjoy this coffee . the flavor is very good ! !####[['coffee', 'food general', 'positive', 'really enjoy'], ['coffee', 'food quality', 'positive', 'very good']]
However , every bag I have used has at least one pod that is ripped .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'negative', 'at least one pod that is ripped']]
The coffee is loose in the bag and the pod is empty . it ' s a real mess and very annoying !####[['coffee', 'food general', 'negative', 'loose'], ['pod', 'food general', 'negative', 'empty'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'negative', 'real mess'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'negative', 'very annoying']]
I think they need better quality control .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'negative', 'need better quality control']]
I REALLY ENJOY THESE BARS####[['BARS', 'food general', 'positive', 'REALLY ENJOY']]

I made the chocolate pudding using the blender instructions ( unbelievably easy and fast ) .####[]
My husband won ' t generally eat tofu , but I gave him a bowl of this and he loved it .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'loved']]
It ' s extra tasty with fresh cut strawberries on top .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'extra tasty']]
If you have non - tofu eaters in your house , give this a try - just don ' t tell them it ' s tofu until after they go yum !####[]
When I first tried these tasty almonds , I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'amazed'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'great']]
Has the kick of wasabi , and the sweet taste of roasted almonds .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'neutral', 'kick of wasabi'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'neutral', 'sweet taste']]
The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times .####[]
