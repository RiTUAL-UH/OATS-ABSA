. . And the first bite tastes great . . . until you chew a little , and all you taste is that chalky , soy - protein powder flavor .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'great'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'neutral', 'chalky']]
I mean , they ' re healthy , convenient and edible  but if you like to chew and really enjoy your food , it ' s disappointing .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'negative', 'disappointing'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'healthy'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'convenien'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'neutral', 'edible']]
I tried two of the three flavors - same problem . )####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'negative', 'same problem']]
This is a stone - ground mustard that is just wonderful on a sandwich or in recipes that call for mustard where it is not completely blended into the other ingredients but is still visible on its own .####[['stone - ground mustard', 'food general', 'positive', 'wonderful']]
The flavor is wonderful ; not too strong or too hot .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'neutral', 'not too strong'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'neutral', 'too hot']]
This isn ' t a Dijon - style mustard and there is no hint of horseradish .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'neutral', 'no hint'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'neutral', "isn ' t a Dijon - style mustard"]]
Try it and you ' ll be hooked .####[['NULL', 'food recommendation', 'positive', "you ' ll be hooked"]]
