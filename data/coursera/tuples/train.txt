I will strongly recommend " Politics and Economics of International Energy " to anyone working or thinking about working on the energy field . This course is also an asset for those advising policymakers or policy - makers themselves . I have learned so much from this course though the materials and interviews . Yes it was challenging because it is good . I can only say that I am glad I made the decision to take the course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
Thank you very much , this course was very helpful for me , I finished my university studies and I had to leave my country because of the war and I could not continue my caree in the new country , this course showed me that it did not stop at this point and I can follow up and even learn the field complitly different  also gave me a lot of tips that will help in learning a new language ( and this is something I need for now ) . thanks again####[['course general', 'positive']]

Great introduction course . Unfortunately the Protools free version is very weak and limited . After I finished the course there was no motivation to go ahead with so many limitations in the SW .

Excellent course ! Very knowledgeable professor , yet easy and pleasant to follow . The programme is well structured and the content approached with some depth ( considering the introductory nature of the course ) . I would have loved to see , though , a focus more on philosophy ( pre - and post - socratic ) , visual arts and the Hellenistic period , as it is most of the times neglected , even in today ' s historical accounts . Hope to see more courses on Classical Studies soon at Coursera .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]

I thoroughly enjoyed taking part in this course . The modules covered a multitude of diverse branches of philosophy which helped me to broaden my knowledge of the subject overall and the lecturers were incredibly helpful in explaining simply , and with useful examples , new information .

I enjoyed Part Two , but not nearly as much as Part One . This change is not due to the professor or the course material ; both are excellent . It is the music itself .

This is merely a starter course that gets you acquainted with the basics of ML using Python .

Excellent introduction for the basic understanding of the Machine Learning . Very good , structured , easy to follow and understand course for anyone whose has previous exposure to linear algebra using MATLAB and Octave . The mentors appear to be very active and hence should not be trouble for anyone without very strong background ( read prerequisite like Linear Algebra especially for the assignments ) . The Assignments are self explanatory enough that I did all of them in just 2 - 3 weeks , thanks to my 2 - 3 years of coding in MATLAB and linear algebra . Thanks very much Prof .

Just finished the course " a little bit " ahead of February . Would have been a resounding five - star review but some " mentor " thought it necessary to hijack a thread by a student asking about the necessity of more than one " break " in a while loop to lecture about what constitutes pseudo - code and what does not on a non - assignment question .

From the Big Bang to Dark EnergyA very interesting survey of the universe from the big bang to the possible future of the universe . Professor Hitoshi Murayama presents the course in a very unassuming and welcoming manner . The idea of dark matter is explained in the problem of galaxy rotation speed , and the idea of dark energy is introduced to explain the strange idea that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate . The idea of discovery of Higgs , dark matter , Cosmic background radiation and atom formation related to the time history of the universe is also introduced . Future telescope / spectroscopic experiments are given in the last lecture , and can be further looked at on the web with more understanding from this course .####[['faculty general', 'positive']]

The videos and explanations are very poor . Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script , and everything feels fake . By reading off a script they are forced to " hand - wave " and do not explain concepts covered completely . The only thing I liked about this course were the problem sets , which were interesting to do . Will not buy rest of specialization , feels like this is just a cash cow for UCSD .####[['material quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'negative']]
The lecture quality should be dramatically improved . Even at 2x speed , I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos . In the conclusion , Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is " new " , but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist , and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old , even more than a decade in some cases . so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist . I ' ve taken more than 5 coursera classes , and this has been my least satisfying .  . . I do appreciate the introduction this provided , for free , and plan to keep learning in this space , though not in this course sequence .####[['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'conflict']]

The course outline is very good , however the presentation ( especially the slides ) can be monotonous .

While the topic is interesting , the materials are poor and the lectures are not particularly insightful . The slides have several mistakes and typos , which makes you doubt the whole course .

Because of this course , I am more aware of opportunities to negotiate in my every day interactions with others . I enjoyed Professor Siedel ' s teaching style . He gets you to think on a deeper level , especially when he poses questions and presents scenarios . The course material is framed in a comprehensive manner . In hindsight , this course on negotiation has shown me how much of a poor negotiator I was . However , I now feel more empowered by what I ' ve learned .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
This is a very short , but useful and highly practical course . It will help you think about your work habits , as well as introduce you to an array of tools to analyze and make changes in whatever areas in your work or personal life you believe should be more productive / fulfilling . It ' s very light on the theoretical aspect , but it does offer you some food for thought . And Ms . Meloni is a delightful instructor - - she actually makes you wish the presentations were a lot longer than they are .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Great subject and some very well presented videos . However there were several which were incomprehensible . Either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a non - American viewer . One doesn ' t always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate . If all the videos had been of good listenable quality I would have given the course 5 stars####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'neutral'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
This is THE BEST course I have ever taken on coursera or else . Very simple but effective , complex things are made bit simple to learn . Just in 3 weeks , covered a good contents .

I ' ve learned about this already from the book Your Memory . However , I believe this course has been a great refresher and I ' ve even learned a few more new things as well . It ' s amazing how some of the techniques taught here seem childish ( make acronyms , imagine / visualize w / humor , etc ) , but are underestimated , overlooked , and ignored . I recommend every person who wants to improve work ethic to take this course as to form a foundation to their learning structure .####[['course general', 'positive']]
Learnt a lot of stuff on how things happen inside all of us . Struggled in few sections , as i have not been in tough with physiology . . .

Very useful for beginners . she speaks very slow and keeps repeating the words until you get it . I really recommend this course for anyone who wants to start learning Chinese .

I learnt a lot in this course that surprised me . I went from being terrified of essays to managing to write one a few pages long . Thank you . My biggest issue and why I didn ' t give it 5 stars if the grading is via peer review and this meant a long wait and lots of begging PLUS getting only one word reviews such as great . Not very helpful . I would like a person who is experienced in essay writing to do a review , but I do understand that , by sheer numbers of students , this would be non viable .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative']]
It ' s my first course on Coursera , and also my first astronomy course .

Adam Frank . Everyone can take this course , even without science background .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
The information presented was interesting , and the instructors were engaging . However , I had major issues with the translation . It was completely literal , and often translated in ways that did not make sense . If I did not have a working knowledge of academic French , I would have been lost .

I have done a few courses on entrepreneurship and venture capital , so I was quite curious to see what this course had to offer , taking the opposite approach . And I must say , that it has been the most valuable learning experience so far for me on Coursera . It ' s really good and it gave me confidence that I ' m on the right track , because I will much rather work with my customers than investors , and then bootstrap until I have to money to grow .####[['course general', 'positive']]
Really Good work on the Course : ) Enjoyed it . . Really Useful . . Keep it up . Hoping for more : ) Dr Chuck is amazing : )####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
This course is simple enough to understand the complexity that is game development but that is not to say it doesn ' t pack a challenge .

We don ' t have children , but I really enjoyed taking this online course on child nutrition and cooking offered by Stanford . Dr .

I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn ' t always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted . For a non - specialist , statistics is almost always a struggle , intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at math . I worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all 6 weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam I said to myself enough is enough . I hate being a quitter , but I was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and self - doubt because I just couldn ' t match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the course . Maybe other people are much smarter than I am , but this source was a soul and time killer for me .####[['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative']]
I have been looking for a stats course to unlock further learning . This was it ! I found the pace , content style worked for me to allow me to proceed on other courses .

The content of this course , like many other courses in coursera is top - notch ! Professor Andrew Ng has unique ability to explain machine learning concepts in a simple and understandable manner . The course structure seems to have been really thought through as at no point did I feel as though I had a gap in knowledge . I would recommend this course to anybody interested in Machine Learning . Dive in , you won ' t regret it .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]

This my first machine learning course and I am very satisfied with it . The bottom - up approach really helped me understand how machine learning evolve . I only cannot understand the proper action to do if I have to use data mining application as modern data mining applications provide diverse algorithms . The hands - on coding assignment is the most valuable lesson for me .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive']]
This course doesn ' t have any writing assignments . I appreciated it because it truly did help me understand the ins and outs of citations , which I needed to know in order to continue on with this course . I tend to get lazy and cute incorrectly because I never had the chance to learn how to do it in school . This professor is very understanding and straight to the point . It ' s what I need for this type of course . If you listen to the professor , it ' s no problem to pass the assignments and quizzes . repetitive . long . too academic . unnecessary terms . The instructor voice is annoying after 2 minutes .

Course is interesting , but sometimes its so hard to perceive the information with such accent : I ` m not lazy to read the subtitles , no . . but they also , from time to time work improperly and its not feasible at all to conceive the information .

This is one of the best courses I have ever taken . It is fun and yet , it is very detailed and , yes , it takes a bit more than 2 - 3 hours per week . You will learn much more than using Tableau . You will learn to ask the right questions and you will also learn how to present your data analytics results to the C - suite or whoever asked for it . I highly recommend this to anyone , beginners and experienced business / data analysts . very useful . all the information covered , are pretty much common sense , and yet people do not pay attention to all the little things discussed in this course . well . i had fun listening to the lectures , and will definitely apply the concepts to my daily routine . tnx####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]

Excellent way to revisit / rethink what it is to learn and how best to go about it . While unquestionably a boon to students , as an adult ( past middle age ) , I took away many important and unexpected tips , techniques , and perspectives . Although I personally had little direct use for the section on Testing , it was still interesting—and I certainly wish I ' d known that material when I was a student . One thing I would have liked to have addressed is how to set up and use self - testing to assist with day - to - day , non - student procedures and learning situations . Both faculty members were engaging and inspired confidence .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Omg , I wish I had these professors to teach us in our college . I have started loving HTML < CSS and Javascript . Being a total newbie to programming I have loved how clear and slow and easy to understand the videos are . Thank you so much and looking forward to completing the entire series . PS : the questions in between the lectures are very helpful and assignments are very very helpful too .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
The title says it all . Great overview of the history , technology , and security of internet . From the title and the nature of these lecture type courses I was worried it would be boring , but not with Dr . Chuck : ) He brings all of the concepts down to earth and help us understand them thoroughly at the same time . Highly recommended for everyone , especially non CS majors jumping into programming !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Dr Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end . This doesn ' t ask too much . It ' s clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session . This course highlights how easy Python is more than anything and that ' s a good thing . Good coding language for beginners . Good course for beginners or novices .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
An amazing course . I wasn ' t expecting much when I enrolled a few weeks ago but the more I studied and watched the lessons I was surprised with so many great tips and resources to understand and become a better learner . I found it funny that there were some techniques that I already use but have never thought on them . I reccomend this course to anyone , either in high school or college , or even as preparation for other courses in Coursera . Why don ' t they teach this in elementary schools ?####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'positive']]
The course was really good and it helped me to get some new learning techniques and ideas . At first when we had to do this course for school I was like : ' This isn ' t going to be any helpfull at all ' .

So I recommend this course to anybody who wants to get better and more efficient at learning .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Colleen van Lent is a great teacher . She simplifies everything , is clear , consistent , and reviews what she ' s said . She explains as she goes and encourages coding along with her .

Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Very good course . Lot of practical information after first 2 - 3 weeks . If only the method would have had tiny bit more variation , such as animations , video analysis , case studies , maybe more expert visitors etc . it would have been even better and more durable in long run . But all in all , highly recomended .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'neutral']]
Highly rated course . This should be a basic learning for every student from about 12 to 77 years old at least . For youngers , it would be very intersting to adapt this course since it looks like it is not an option sor successful studies . Thank you very much to Barbara OAKLEY and other teachers . Thank you to San Diego University and Coursera .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
A practical course by a capable professor . Too simple in terms of theoretical aspects , but Prof . Ng is very good at making abstract concepts and methodologies easy to follow and understand . Great course as an introductory to Machine Learning . If you are interested , and want to learn more about the proof and in - depth mathematics behind , go to Stanford ' s site for this course . There are lecture notes , slides and exercises that students use when taking the course at Stanford .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
The Professor is excellent and very student - friendly , and the course material is very clear . Two issues though : 1 ) List comprehensions should be introduced . They are extremely powerful and should really be introduced at this stage . 2 ) Charging $ 79 for this course seems like poor value for money , specially for a student like me . It doesn ' t go into great detail and the price point for what is a 5 - 6 hour course with simple exercises seems too high .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course value', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
This course gives general information on the magic of middle ages . However , I wish the course could be arranged in a more logical and coherent way , such as geographical or chronological , which will help to understand and memorize . Material in Week 4 is very confusing . It is hard to get the key points from those materials and what the instructors want to tell me . On the other hand , materials in Week 2 is easy to be understood and reflected in the first written assignment .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'neutral'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Sorry to say that , but this course has nothing related to programming . I like Dr . Chuck courses , especially 2 - 4 in this specialization , but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots . If you have any programming experience you don ' t need this course it doesn ' t pay off your time you spend for this . Sorry again , but it ' s my opinion .####[['course relatability', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative']]
I appreciate the effort that went into making this course as well as obtaining the film clips . Having said that , if you want to go deeper into the psychology of memory this course is probably not for you . As I progressed through the weeks , I found myself becoming less and less interested since I already know the basics of memory and psychology . I felt I wasn ' t learning anything new but the clips of films allowed me to see the films in a new light . Maybe if I had bought the book that goes along with the course , i would have gained more insight but as a standalone course , it rates just three stars .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
I think this was a very good course . Level of instruction and pace were appropriate for someone with 2 hours / week to spend and who wanted to improve their knowledge of these topics . Its probably more useful for someone with some previous experience , limited time and some problems they want to solve , rather than a student . It had a good balance between a lot of breadth for time invested . If you approach this as a high - level overview that will help you efficiently focus your own search for knowledge it ' s extremely well done ; I thought knowledge communicated for the amount of time spent was quite high .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'neutral']]
I ' m sorry , but this is just ridiculous . I can ' t recommend this course to anyone . It ' s all about advertizing Emily Fox can ' t stop but recommend Amazon services , and Carlos Guestrin does the same for his Dato ' s Graphlab Create , which is might be great in general , but absolutely useless in educational purposes . The practice part of every week is just a waste of the time . I can ' t say " money well spent " .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative']]
This course is not prepared as well . You see several video with animated presentation and typical ( vocabulary ) terms . It is not for beginners because in course you didn ' t find answers .

This was a superb course . Very accessible for the non - specialist . Matt McGue is an excellent lecturer and very clear and conscientious about his subject .

The lectures were not very interesting or instructive . The reading materials were much more so . However , the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self - reflection than on the materials . I learned a little bit , and as such found the course worth the time I put into it , but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials , and thus derive very little benefit from it . I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping .  In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials , I think more real - life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition . )####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['material relatability', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'neutral']]

The instructor needs improvement on her presentation skills . She is just reading off the slides instead of providing more examples and scenarios to help student comprehend the material .

This is an excellent course . It ' s very thought - provoking and provides insight into meditation - - a subject that eludes many people . The course needs more quizzes to help students learn and remember the knowledge taught in the lectures .

A very useful course that teaches techniques I could implement at work almost from day 1 . Prof . Peng teaches the material in a very clear , well structured manner , and provides good real life examples . The course provides a suite of tools and techniques for data analysis that ' s a great starting point to build from .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
This course was extremely helpful for me , although I ' m already familiar with a lot of concepts and researches about learning . It ' s well structured and sometimes sims to be to precise , but then it ' s become obvious , that it follows all the tips it ' s talking about . So now that I finished it , it ' s impact on my learning is a matter of practice ) It ' s also very inspiring to see all of the personal examples ( see additional interviews ) , especially from Dr . Barbara Oakley since I also didn ' t expect that I would study math - related subjects .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman ' s Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology . I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved ( the studies Dr . Fredrickson refers to are for the most part only touched on briefly ) , and to have spent less time listening to the on - site students discussing their personal opinions ( though I appreciated their insights , I would have liked to have learned more actual information ) . I did get something out of the experiential activities . Although they are optional , I would recommend doing them to really get something out of the class . They allowed me to stop and think about things I may not have made the time for otherwise .####[['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]

Really interesting course , I really enjoy the class with Dr . Chuck because he makes easy explanation of different concepts in programming that makes the excersices easy to solve . I have learned about data structures , a topic that I barely had knowledge and I hope I can apply this new knowledge in my future master course or at my future work . Keep doing videos Dr .

This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic , but doesn ' t go into much depth . While it ' s clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material , I still would not recommend this course . Both the presentation itself and the in - video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious . The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to , and the in - video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time . Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities , which are badly designed and just frustrating . Overall , I recommend waiting for a better course .####[['course general', 'neutral'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
I did the free part of the course . It was too simpleI did other free MOOCs that had much more . The videos were like reading a book . The subject is interesting and there ' s some potential to the practical part of the course . I only did the first 3 weeks####[['course value', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Excellent course ! It ' s been ten years I didn ' t take any course ( actually since I ' m an engineer ) and I ' ve never been so happy to watch a course or to do an exercice . Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher and he knows how to detail complex problem with simple words . I definitively recommend this course . It ' s an excellent introduction to machine learning .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn ' t sufficient . Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes . This is the reason why Andrew Ng ' s Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging . Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful . I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Coursework was quite easy . Used a lot of the techniques learned in the other courses . You ' ll get the most out of this course if you have a data analysis project that you want to do .

This course was great . It is obvious that it was carefully planned and laid out . The visiting scholars were a great opportunity to not only learn about historical fiction and what kind of research is done , it ' s also was a great way to learn the process of writing .

The lectures and practicals are very easy to understand . The programming homework is a little bit hard for a python beginner to finish . I wish there are more hints or test examples . It would be better to include some reference papers for those who are more interested in the sequencing techniques and methods to read by themselves .

Very interesting course . Truly enjoyed studying the behaviour of the animals I started appreciating a lot . Nevertheless 4 out of 5 stars because I felt the course is typically focusing on the large scale agro industrial side more then the ( increasing number ) of small scale / hobby keepers . Also I would have loved to learn more about typical chicken health care issues and how to prevent .

It is an excellent introduction to R . It required me to do more reading than what was provided via videos and slide decks .

There is a lot of self - teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions . In addition , the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding . At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code . This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative']]

This is a lousy course . The subject and material could be interesting ; however , the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic ' s cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you ' ve understood the key points of the lectures ! While this course was a timed release ( implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week , it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration ; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students .

Simple and practical guidelines which can be followed easily .

Amazing - way more depth than the first course , and much narrower focus . Emily teaches all courses here and dives into the math and usage .

I DON ' T recommend this course AT ALL . This college doesn ' t spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos ( less than 10mins in total per a week ) and external references ( which someone else wrote ) . The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other . I haven ' t learn anything from this course . It ' s just a waste of time and money . Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses / specializations provided by other universities though , A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning . This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques , concepts and best practices . If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist , this is your gateway .

Great course ! I highly recommend it both for teachers and teacher trainers . All content is delivered in a very engaging manner . Although I have already had a solid previous experience in the area , I have gained a lot from this course . It is definitely worth taking if you are interested in effective professional development . the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms . For example , the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market . Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year . for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15 % , then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course value', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]

This is a very good introduction to machine learning . It covers a very broad set of material , and the lectures are very clear . The quizzes and programming assignments are based directly on the course material , making it easy to complete the assignments if you understand the lecture material ( in contrast with some other courses I have taken where the assignments require lots of extra material not taught in the course ) . It is very helpful to have some programming experience , and some knowledge of linear algebra , probability , and calculus . The course is very topical , so it does not go very deep into the material , but it does offer some practical advice for using machine learning algorithms in daily applications .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative']]
Very interesting course . I found the reading material sources particularly relevant without exceeding unnecessary in quantity and issues .

Great introduction to Java . Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start , rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses , which is really cool .

The course is really good with a lot of intuition and technical details . The assignments and quizzes help clarify concepts and ideas . However the course requires a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics , so it may not be a course for people without such background . In addition , since the course has been out there for a few years , not many people joined my session and only a handful of people participated in the discussion forum . The forum has been quiet and not much help can be sought from the forum .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative']]

I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area , as well as great machine learning enthusiasts . However , I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and ( very ! ) expensive platform , mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning .

I would be honoured if I ever get a chance to meet Mr . Ang in person or attend one of his lectures .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Well I liked the course untile the last assignment . It says you need 3 hours for this assignment but I could finish it after two days and I am good in programming ) . The last assignment is not really well designed specially the trajectory part . The rest of the course was good .####[['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Excellent . Instructor delivers in conversational tone and with many examples and excerpts . The recommended reading list , with links to most items , is worth the time spent on them . I have lived and worked in the tech world through the primary eras he discusses , 60 ' s to today , and seeing the legal issues affecting the development and use of emerging technologies has been enlightening . I would be interested in seeing this approach applied to matters of privacy and security .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Professor Fowler is great ! He spends some time explaining the theory behind the topic , and makes everything pretty easy to visualize . I would love if there were a few more resources with example problems . The quizzes can be pretty challenging , if you haven ' t done any practice problems first . My favorite thing about this MOOC and Prof . Fowler is his excitement - - which makes it feel , less like a lecture and more , like a fun conversation about calculus .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral']]
Its such an awesome course but need a lot of practice apart from the practice exercises . If we don ' t make a note of the concepts or didn ' t practice we cant memorize anything . Jeff Leek , he is such a great professor . I think he is the best when it comes to explaining something . I am doing Data Science Specialization .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quantity', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]

Machine Learning is an excellent course with great presentations . This is not an easy course , and I found myself reviewing concepts and being challenged to dive deeper into the material . The assignments are difficult , but the tutorials on the discussion boards from the course mentor made all of the difference . I highly recommend the linear algebra review as well . I now have a much better understanding of how the machine learning algorithms work after having completed the course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'neutral'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
It ' s good for undergraduates , and people returning to academia ( say , before starting a Master ' s course ) . It ' s a very short simple introduction . I kind of wish it had more examples of language to use in academic writing , contrasting good and bad examples . Some of the quiz questions and final exam questions need some proofreading . The videos from about week 3 to 4 have poor sound quality , but still understandable .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
Andrew Ng teaches a great Machine Learning course . Ng speaks clearly and the flow of the class is easy to follow . The examples made things clear and the homework exercises really cemented the learning points . Overall , the class was just the right amount of challenge and fun . I now have a solid understanding and intuition about Machine Learning and will use what I ' ve learned .

This is an ok introductory course , a compilation of concepts , related to sustainable cities . Mentiones a list of places where one or another practice is implemented . Some educational clips look like they are taken from Youtube or like promo videos for a certain initiative . Some of the " lecturers " are just phd students , introducing their research topics . No step - by - step examples of developed cases are shown .####[['material quality', 'neutral'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course general', 'neutral'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
This course is a must for students and teachers alike . As a final year neuroscience PhD candidate I expected to know by now how to learn , yet I got a wealth of advice and new insights . It is a very useful course , with two very good teachers . Not only do they give you great studying and test taking tips , which you can apply immediately ( which is why I think teachers should follow this course as well ) , they give you a lot of scientific background to these tips .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I very concise overview . The teacher is excellent . I would have liked more real life examples , e . g . looking at the numbers for real life companies and comparing them to others and seeing what we could learn from these numbers about these companies .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
This was great It made me think of the Social media aspect of the Photography buisness in a different light . I was really blown away the way they helped me with lighting in this course .

Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course . Booksite , video materials and assignments are amazing . Would recommend this course to everyone ! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in KD tree . Critical information when to prune the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted . not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks . hard for a student ( even one who has a programming background ) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront . The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course . the whole course seems disjointed . would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
Excellent course ! One of the best I have ever taken on photography . It opens up a large variety of topics and plots them along the evolution of photography from its very beginning to today . All of the content was hugely interesting , the materials and required readings were well - chosen and , most important of all , the course opened my eyes to many new possibilities of creative expression . This course is a must for anyone seriously interested in the subject of photography .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
Moderator answer in a very short time . I was impressed of that . I think the course should add a video to explain more in details some concept as variables . many of my issues were coming from deep doubts i had about this . maybe explain variables on hardware and variables as pointers .####[['faculty response', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
After the first week , the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums . The capstone project itself was disappointing , I learned much more from doing my own app in class # 3 . I took the Coursera Android specialization , which was eons better than this . I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone . I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto .####[['faculty general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
Dr . Tompkin is one of the best professors I have had the pleasure to encounter . That is going some because I have two PhDs . He clearly and concisely explains important concepts , putting the subject matter within reach of anyone who is interested . I hope that he will offer more courses .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
The content of the slides were sufficient for the basic intent of this offering . The overview and reasoning behind why the products are competitive for other contending services was clear . When performing the labs , the content is very recipe driven . While that works well for someone attempting to get the work done , there needs to be some visuals prepared that show how the GCP components are laid out and the relationship they have to each other ( simple architecture views ) . The GCP products have very similar sounding names , so paragraphs describing what is happening have less effect , whereas some simple architecture views of what the lab is intending to do to go with that in the lab content itself , might help .####[['presentation quality', 'positive']]
This course has been highly delightful to learn through the concepts of machine learning . For someone like me having 17years programming experience , and with some hands on of neural networks from colelge days , and analytic tools for a few applications in R ; it is a great refresher on the fundamentals and great breadth of practical technology elements that are most useful in machine learning applications . Andrew ' s teaching method is great . His clear and simplistic delivery style of complex concepts with apt examples ensures the student grasps the essence with ease and works navigates his way through complex algorithms with confidence . I would love sitting through his lectures in the future too !

This is my first course in coursera . It feels great to have been taught by the field head of machine learning .

Prof . Schiller provides a full picture on financial markets . Don ' t expect only mathematical finance to be taught . He places great emphasis on the behavioural side as well .

I thought this was a very interesting course on a topic I knew nothing about . Apart from the history of the Jews in China I learnt a great deal about China in the 19th and 20th century . My only criticism of the course was the very confusing rubric for peer marking the assignments . The criteria were very specific and , in my view , didn ' t necessarily reflect the subject of the essay .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class . This class was at it ' s best during the recitals , where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative']]
The instructors are very knowledgeable and lectures contain a lot of valuable information . I ' m enjoying the mixture of basics and detail , plus the field trips to LHC and a tokamac . There ' s a fair amount of work required , but I appreciate that . There ' s also plenty of activity in the discussion forums . I notice that some students have complained about having to pay attention to the lectures . This course is possibly not a good choice for anyone who wants to be spoon fed .####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive']]
A beutiful course - From Freedom Rides to Ferguson : Narratives of Nonviolence in the American Civil Rights Movement . This is a historical event that keeps updating itself every day .

People from everywhere in the world can now learn about this .####[['course general', 'positive']]
I found the course very informative and interesting . The variety and concentration of detail was impressive and the lecturer always engaging and clearly strongly invested in the material . He was also very sensitive to his audience . I would certainly recommend the course and hope to find other courses run by the same lecturer .

Much harder than I thought . Very in - depth introductory learning of python . Preferably better if you allow scripting in . py because notebook is rather heavy and hard todebug while assignments . Hope you cover a bit more in detail with language structure , as well as give hints for solving assignments , since many parts were pretty above course level . I would say the assignments were hard even for an R practitioner learning python like myself .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
In my opinion , Andrew Ng excels in teaching this course . He is able to keep you interested on the course by letting you know what are the most important things you need to carry on from each session . The content of the course is really good , videos , transcripts , slides , etc . Actually , several sites now suggest taking this course before moving into a more deep level of M . L .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Disappointed by this class . Instructor and mentors added not value to course . The main reading " eMarketing " was good but all video content and assignments were directly from the " eMarketing " guide by Rob Stokes . Also . they couldn ' t even get Rob Stokes name spelled correctly in the references .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
This course is exceptionally well put together . I had this wrong concept that machine learning is a hard nut to crack but Prof . Ng has designed the course in such a way that students get the best out of the machine learning course with fair amount of effort . Nearly to the end of the course . I wish this course was a part of specialization for Machine Learning and AI .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
This is a very interesting and rewarding course . It would help if the format was broken up a bit more . Perhaps with some video of power plants , turbines , etc .

For any one familiar with R and wants to get to know about Python , this is right the course you want to go for . Dr . Chuck ' s lecturing style is really inspiring , humorous , and helpful . I am planning to finish everything in this 5 - course specialization , and this first course definitely gives you a good start in mastering this wonderful language . Thanks ! very fundamental . however , I do think it was a bit bold to state that on completion of the course that students would have the skills to write essays independently . Following the grading of some peer assignments , I would be concerned if that were still the case . Otherwise , I found some useful tools for writing in all the courses .

A very thought - engaging and enjoyable course . I learned a lot about the history and contexts of various Muslim countries , the challenges faced by them as well as the practical challenges that Islamic - based political thought have not demonstrably addressed so far . The instructor is very knowledgeable and well - meaning . I like the course ' s approach of not so much attempting to answer the questions as just a ' tour guide ' and an entry point to the much more complex discussion about the topic . I might not agree with everything in the course , and some of his statements might have made me a bit uncomfortable , but overall this is an engaging and insightful course .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
The whole course is basically a short topic based phrasebook being read - out and over - explained in English . Since I already speak English , this isn ' t very useful . The course contains no dialogues , or any real situations where vocab ' s being reviewed .

Better just use an audio - phrasebook and repeat it using the same time .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
It is a wonderful course for serious learners wanting to learn about the human nervous system and how it works . I myself am a medical doctor ( I graduated over two years ago ) and I can attest that ( in my university at least ) I didn ' t have neuroscience lectures with this depth and detail . Due to my medical background I found it comfortable to go through the course without much effort or lots of extra studying . But I figure that if you do not have some such foundation it might be a bit more challenging to go smoothly with the course , and you might needs more extra studying and more time put into the course . But if you are interested about neuroscience and want to learn the essentials of how the human brain works ( as per our current knowledge ) then I recommend that you put in the effort and go with the course even if you don ' t have a strong background in the life sciences or in medicine . Many thanks to Dr White and everybody else who have participated in creating and maintaining this course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Great course ! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve . The case studies were relevant and interesting , and the guest speakers were good as well . I wish discussions had been a little more structured - it was kind of a free - for - all which led to a lot of off - topic nonsense to weed through . After the second week , I really stopped checking in because it was too time consuming and that ' s a little sad . But that would be my only suggestion for improvement .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]

Breadth with Depth ! " That ' s what you ' ll get from taking this course ( quoted because those are the words used to describe the general education pattern at my university ) . I never used the forums for this course and had to learn software than what I ' m used to working with ( sci - kit ) . When stuff worked it was rewarding , but other than that , expect to read documentation if you get stuck . Finally , for anyone who want to know what Machine Learning is about , this courses is the sampler of what is to come in later courses .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
I had a lot of fun during this course , but I think it is simply too short to present all the topics in sufficient detail . Furthermore , I took this course without doing the prior courses in the specialization , and there were a couple of moments when I really thought previous knowledge from a different course was required . I think for the most part the lecturers did a great job in explaining the materials in the course . The lectures themselves were also well structured , and the topics followed each other in a logical order . I would have loved to spend more time on modeling techniques and Markov Chain Monte Carlo .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]

lecturer is very monotone and isn ' t engaging . Course also focuses a lot on the history when it would be more relevant to look to the future . It is peer graded which is extremely unreasonable , people do not read the submissions fully or fully have the knowledge to be able to grade someone else ' s work . People also have different standard which causes a large variation in grades . Grading rubric does not include areas for where extra research has been done either####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'neutral'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

Great case study , but the way to engage the audience might have been way better . Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power , because they were quite boring . Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment .

Great course . my constructive criticism has to do with the organizing of the group activities , it ' s just very difficult to organize into groups via people whom you have not met , especially given the time zone differences as well the differences in daily schedules for group members . I just wonder if there ' s a possibility to organize the group projects in such a way that the website allows for better asynchronous work ( not just emailing back and forth as that feels very disorganized ) ? Otherwise I feel that I learned a lot and I feel that this is a great intro class . i ' ve learned tons of new things . i would like to have more materials on the subject . could the staff attach some recommended readings ? other courses ? than you for making this course : )####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'neutral']]
This is an extremely basic course . In my opinion , it isn ' t worth $ 49 and is thrown in just to add to the total price of the specialization .

You could also get this info from watching Youtube videos .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative']]
Good overview and introduction to the more detail content of the following courses . If you are not familiar with Python , this will ease you into the language and enable you to follow . There is a certain style of teaching that you need to get accustomed too in the beginning but when it is done , lessons become very clear and easy to follow . Moreover , it becomes " so what is happening next ? " and you are looking forward to the next lesson . Again , this is mainly an overview ( with content ) and a lot of the material will be reviewed more in detail afterwards .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
This course was sooo useful ! I am starting college in the fall and thought this might help me ; it definitely will . The main instructor is great ; she explains things very well .

I ' ve already written a review for part 1 and I have the same opinion about this one . The course is rather poor and not challenging .

This is one of if not the best course that I have taken . The instructor is outstanding and I find the lectures well prepared and well delivered . As an anthropology - zoology major and a meditator of about 5 - years , I find this course as an incredible bridge between the science of the brain and the practice of mindfulness . I hope that Robert Wright will continue to create offerings for the Coursera world ! Thank you so much for creating and providing this material .

Pace is extremely slow . The instructor writes and talks simultaneously . The words are put so slow that it puts me off too sleep at times . I love taking courses where the instructor speaks at the right pace and keeps you involved . Carlos , the co instructor .

Too prescriptive and prone to lists . Do these 21 things when editing a novel " . If that ' s what I was looking for , I could search the web for blogs .

This class was really difficult . The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes ( particularly in Week 3 & 4 ) and the final exam was immensely difficult . Additionally , the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i . e . repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs . I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn ' t have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
I am very much enjoying how my professor breaks everything down to the simplest form . I find myself applying what I have learned to my everyday writing as well as things I read and watch . He is upbeat and energetic and the assignments are fun ! Although he asks for 200 words and I find that difficult because I am accustomed to writing a small novel for each answer , as you can clearly tell from my review of this course . I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to begin writing or to writers who want a fundamental understanding of what they are already doing .####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]

This course presents relevant topics for machine learning in a very didatic way and in a very interesting sequence . The teacher really knows the topic , the comunity is engaging and the material is really well crafted . I totally recommend this to you if you already have a little programming background ( matlab is a plus ) . If you don ' t , i sincerely recommend that you study a little matlab and linear algebra , although this is not 100 % required for passing the tests , it is essential for your complete understanding of the subject .

There is quality implicit in the approach taken , but in my opinion , this course is excessively short , having only 20 - 25 minutes of videos per week , what is very limiting . Also there is no slides of the material covered what I find not adequate . To fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures , slides would be determinant . Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quantity', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
I audited this course . The videos are in fact useful . However , it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course . Thus moving from theory to application can be a bit abstract . Of course I did purchase the book and workbook created by the author and have found them to have additional material to support application .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
I really enjoyed this course . I thought that the teacher was very helpful and thorough for an introduction course .

The assignments are not really commensurate to the content , i . e . they are much simpler and superficial and do not really test the content , which is deeper and implies practical activities difficult to measure . The title is also partially misleading , at least for me , and I would rather call it a blues introduction to jazz improvisation . But the content and the exercises proposed are great , one of the best and no nonsense approach to bebop improvisation I ' ve ever found####[['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
This AWESOME course could help me to remove my bad character of learning process and methodology , actually I tough that my IQ is low since I have spend to much for study on my lessons but after watching course videos and see how our brain nerves system works I realized that not only my IQ is in good range but also I understand that I have creative memory .

This course on software security was very informative . This is the best place to start off for a beginner as it not only covers the technical aspects of security , but also talks about modelling threats and identifying adversaries and their capabilities . I however was slightly disappointed with the testing methods of this course . I feel that most of the testing should have been on the basis of projects and a project should have been included every week . But , all in all taking the course was a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly enjoyed all the projects that were given .

This course is excellently organised . You will learn very interesting things about Machine Learning , but you will also work your programming skills ( MATLAB / Octave ) . You don ' t need to know a lot of algebra or programming , although every knowledge is useful . Professor Andrew Ng is excellent and all the exercises are very well explained . Forums are VERY useful too , you will get help and feedback from teachers and other students very quickly .

The course is amazing , the professor gives you right examples an amount of information for understanding the topics .

Overall very detailed and informative . A great way to get insight into English Common Law .

Very interesting , up - to - date and relevant concepts on marketing and communication tools and how they relate to the fundamental goal of achieving long - term brand loyalty . I like the practical examples used as they help to illustrate the concepts well . If a little more coverage could be provided on digital marketing , it would be great . Nonetheless , this is a great course for introducing the fundamentals of traditional marketing and communication tools . Great description on the theoretical concepts related to advertising strategies especially - some psychology involved , in the context of consumer behaviour , and I appreciate these associations especially since Psychology is my undergraduate major .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive']]
This course is an excellent survey of introductory sales techniques and thinking . In addition , it allows you to access Craig Wortmann ' s " Sales Toolkit " , which I think is highly valuable and able to be carried over into other personal / professional situations . However , the rigor of feedback from classmates was sometimes lacking , and the problem sets / videos took hardly any time . More time could be spent on them , but without more intense feedback from seasoned sales professionals , it might not be worth the investment . Overall , I am satisfied with having paid for this course in order to get that feedback and the certificate .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course value', 'positive']]
The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions . The topics are covered by providing plenty of background explanation , though I found the repetition way too much at times . I would have liked to see the English in the slides , transcription of the videos , and most importantly , in the quizzes , proofread - at times , the seemingly small errors made it hard to understand what the quiz questions were about .

I found the course to be taught exceptionally well . Andrew is clearly passionate about ML as well as educating the masses about it . The use of real - life examples is a fantastic learning aid , in the videos and in the programming exercises .

The module is overall great and gave me an intro on how game documents are developed , plus it made me start thinking like a game designer ( I hope ! ) My only complaint is that the homework is fairly restrictive only one - page game per week , which means there ' s only so much you can do ) but I do appreciate the fact that it simplifies things and if anything it pushes you to be even more creative , beyond the typical " board game " .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quantity', 'negative']]

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work . I get the feeling this is quite a new course ( compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization ) and does not have the student interaction base yet .

I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities , but this course is clearly biased . The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest . A university is meant to teach the whole story , and have a truthful account of facts . I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals , on the pretext of unbiased learning . This course clearly has an agenda . I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not .####[['course quality', 'negative']]

At this point , I think that the course is good , however there should be more reviews . Three reviews of people who is also learning is not enough , in my opinion . I have received some comments like ' some sentences are not good ' . Which tells me absolutely nothing . I think people should be encouraged to exemplify what they mean , to take the sentences that they believe that are wrong , and extend why . For the rest , the course is very good .####[['course general', 'positive']]
I enjoyed the course a lot ! It ' s amazing how it is simple and thrilling at the same time . You have an opportunity to create simple but cool games which make you feel so proud of yourself .

The course is definitely high - quality and the topics are covered in a good way . I ' m not giving 5 stars because I would have expected SVMs and neural networks . Mentioning the many different algorithms for learning decision trees would have been nice , without necessarily focusing on each of them in depth . An entire week spent on precision / recall seems a little bit too much , without touching other metrics like F - score .

Outstanding course . My only feedback is you force the students to use Octave / MATLAB . I used Python do all the assignments but I didn ' t bother submitting my answers to get credit for the course because I would have had to reimplement it again in Octave .

I would have liked to have actually implemented a SVM rather than use a lib ( at - least one time ) .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['assignments quantity', 'neutral']]

It is a great course for me . At the end of the course , I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation . As opposed to the stated prerequisite , I believe the course requires engineering / math / physics background . On the down side , there is no TA presence in the discussion forum . You will need to rely on your classmates if you are stuck . Also the second assignment requires hours of tuning , which serves almost no educational purpose .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]

There is some good content on creativity in this course , thoug it barely addresses problem solving .  Do something different " assingments were an interesting idea . Some content material is missing , including the link to a text that is needed to answer a quizz which will influence your final grade . Grading standards are weird : maximum grades are to be given to assignments performed in public , as if things done in private aren ' t creative ; there are better ways to have someone get out of their comfort zone . Assingments request that you be photographed or filmed , and there is no disclaimer that your photos or your privacy will be protected . If you are an introvert or simply a person who values privacy , this is not the course for you .####[['material quality', 'conflict'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'conflict']]
The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .####[['material quality', 'conflict'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
Very very bad communication from the teachers . The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2 . 5 months ago , it did not start at the time of this review .

If you have some background programming in another language , and some familiarity with HTML / CSS , this course does a fantastic job introducing both Ruby and Rails . The first week walks you through machine and environment setup , the second walks through the basics of the Ruby programming language , and the third walks through using the Rails framework to develop simple websites in Ruby . All the lessons are laid out clearly with solid examples . That said , this is not a beginner course . It really only spends a week covering how to program in Ruby , and Ruby has some quirks that make it a challenging first language . If you ' re brand new to programming , do yourself a favor and take an introductory course first .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'neutral']]
Very nice course with solid foundation and great examples . One recommendation would be to split the material on Week 4 into 2 weeks : Week 4 and Week 5 . The teachers would have more time for explaining every bit in the lectures so the difficulty would step up evenly between weeks . Other than the amount of material on last week , it is a good course and highly recommended ! its fun and well taught but i was having a little trouble understanding how to go about some of the topics here this course being my first ever programming class i have ever taken . all in all i enjoyed every bit of it and its something i see myself doing in the future .

Excellent material , fabulous tutor , Ι ' d really be glad if I could have Professor Severance in real - life class .

The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python , I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically . Where it falls down though is the assignment auto - grader . It ' s immensely fussy ( as I understand it has to be ) , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don ' t sufficiently explicitly define whats expected . This means you spend more than 50 % of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so . I would recommend this course , but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]

While there are a few technical issues , this is an awesome course . Not only is it is very detailed and informative , but entertaining and sometimes even amusing . Being so detailed and informative , a lot of the material is quite challenging . The tests in particular are tough . However , I highly recommend this course because it will make you really appreciate astronomy as a field and the solar system .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]

The content of the course is so good . However , I think the lecturers can do better job if the have more visualisation for what they are saying . A lot of time , I felt that I couldn ' t follow what they was saying and then , I have to pause the video and look at the pseudo code , it much easier to understand . Btw , thanks a lot for providing such an awesome course .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
Dr . Ibrahim Odeh , was capable to put a five weeks course that surpass many other courses of one year lenght , the mix of theory and quizes based on real experience of top notch professionals of the construction field was great !

Congratulations Professor Odeh !####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Salvatore is outstanding ! I would happily pay for more courses like this . Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us ! It ' s been a fantastic experience and I can ' t wait to put what I ' ve learned to use . Thank you again !####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
If you happen to have the required background but somehow never got beyond beginner - level GR , this is a thoroughly enjoyable course ! There are obviously many text - books and online videos to learn more - or - less the same concepts , but the assignments here are the high point , they are hard , but for me personally , they are what made this course special . Completing this course somehow makes me feel much better prepared to self - study the intermediate / advanced level GR books I ' ve owned for so long ! Many thanks to Prof . Akhmedov , HSE , and Coursera for making this possible !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Great class to take if you ' re a beginner or more of an advanced writer to refresh your learning on the subject . Love how I also got to learn about the editing and publishing process as well . Definitely would not have minded if the class were a few weeks longer . Very glad I signed up and took this course . I am more motivated to continue my life as a writer .####[['course general', 'positive']]
Great Course for beginners , without any programming knowledge . I am suggesting to take this course before you will do any other courses . This course helped me to learn on other python courses , which were overestimated as " for beginners " but needed already some programming knowledge . In this course all assignments are based on learned material ( based on lecture ) . I am glad that I took this course first .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
A very good course . The best what I have seen in this area . I would make only some minor changes but I didn ' t watch the first course so there might be some complementary information what I don ' t know or wanted this course to have . The first 3 weeks is nice package for learning Bootstrap .####[['course general', 'positive']]
It ' s a great course , which is very helpful to learn some difficult things . Thanks very much . The only problem is my English is too weak to follow the English subtitle , so I have to use Chinese subtitle . Anyway , the course teach me how to learn in a better way , I will introduce it to my students . Thanks again . BTW , it ' s my first course which is finished in Coursera .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Im very happy to see that the authors improved the course by actually showing the students how to integrate JS and HTML . I still can ' t understand why its not allowed the access to the projects to students that won ' t purchase the course . There are several of other courses @ Coursera that require payment only if you want the certificate . I guess that hundreds of students would be happy to see that as the general procedure . Thanks to all the authors for such a wonderful material . Im continuing to the 2nd level of the specialisation .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Only shows a bit of javascript , css , and html snippets . If you expect to learn from this course , dont bother they mostly refer you to w3schools . com . They assume everyone knows how to code in html , javascript and css . At one point in the course the teacher says , if you don ' t know : Google , Yahoo , etc . , but if you are going to have to google 99 % of things , it ' s pointless taking this course .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
This will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason . The entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses . As a result this is a pretty bland and boring 4 weeks . The assignments feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded . The saving grace is that the course is just 4 weeks and can be completed in a fairly short amount of time .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
This course is excellent . I like the " learn by doing " method adopted and during the course you built a good website .

Beautiful ! Insightful ! Eye Opener ! I wish I had known these things when I was a kid ! I would have achieved much more than I have .

Was a little too basic . Would have preferred more flesh ( both implementational and mathematical ) on the bones . I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly " this is for the experts in linear algebra " . Come on ! If one is taking a machine learning course , one can expect more from the students . Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap - dance on the surface of the material .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
If there hadn ' t been so many hiccups with the videos and quizzes I would recommend this course . However , I lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete videos and trying to complete quizzes covering material that was not addressed or only partially addressed in the videos . Then had to go back and Review all the videos once they had been re - uploaded . It was a very frustrating experience . I lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignments and quizzes .####[['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'conflict'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
This a really good course . I love the way Mr . Andrew teaches us . He makes everything so simple and easy to understand !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
An in - depth survey of perhaps most of the current techniques in machine learning . Very well presented , in a well - paced and understandable fashion .

Highly recommended .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive'], ['material workload', 'positive']]
Jim Fowler has the ability to visualize complex concepts , make them easier to comprehend . He really made this course interesting .

I looked at several other online iOS courses , I even purchased a couple before a friend suggested Coursera . The UCI program is one of the best introductions to Objective - C and iOS programming that I ' ve come across . The curriculum is well thought out and follows a logical progression . Don does an excellent job presenting the concepts in a way that is easy to follow , but not overly simplified . Grading is done as peer reviews , which is nice as it allows you to see how your fellow peers approached the problem . I really enjoyed this course and am looking forward to the next one .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'positive']]
Recommended ( ! ! ! ! ) to everyone who wants to understand where the greatest invention ever came from .

A lot of great insight and knowledge here ; well worth the time . I almost didn ' t give it five stars , because I feel that they could have made room for just a bit more explanation and just a few more examples of the topics covered . Some of this is heady stuff , and doesn ' t benefit from being glossed over . Regardless , what you DO get out of this course is well worth the effort . Put in the time , and you ' ll be rewarded .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'neutral']]
Great course ! The scope was just right , giving a broad enough introduction to spark interest and give the tools to further delve into machine learning applications . The course work was particularly useful - the use of Octave to get your hands dirty is a tremendous teaching tool . 10 / 10 would recommend !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
The course is amazing , the professor gives you right examples an amount of information for understanding the topics . After you finish the course you are not an expert but you have the right concepts and knowledge for developing your projects .

I audit the course but I did all the homework , you must do the homework to really understand the topics .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'positive']]
Very good course . It has transformed my approach to career development .

It was a great experience learning how to learn . Thanks this course I found where I am doing wrong and actually I´am learning new things easier and time after time I repeat the information that I have studied some years ago . I used to consider the fact that I am interested in many different things as a problem and all these years I was searching to find something I really like most to succeed but thanks to Barbara I learned that you can start learning anything even the things you are not good at , just by efficient study .

The course is really great and I ' m learning a lot from it . It ' s clearing a lot of my doubts and now I feel I ' m actually learning AngularJS for real . Thanks Yaakov ! You ' re the best ! besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues , the way of teaching is well adapted to on - site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together ; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google ( or stackoverflow or whatever ) really ? ! somehow it seems they just took an on - site course , played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC . they seem not really aware of the fact that on - site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC ( Dr .

This course was simple . Since it is intended as an overview of few machine learning techniques used to build computer based rational agents it has completely fulfilled my curiosity about what intelligent applications can be built using machine learning algorithms . Professors Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin did an excellent job of presenting the course in an engaging way and with enough hands - on exercises to better understand the lessons . I am excited to take the next specialization courses to better understand the inner workings of each algorithm , and perhaps manage to understand why these algorithms work the way they do , specially the Deep Learning algorithms . Thank you Coursera for the opportunity and thank the Professors Emily and Carlos for such a valuable gift of sharing knowledge for free .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Machine Learning is a complete course about the mathematical techniques to make computers learn by themselves . In this course you will study the rationale behind mathematical algorithms and learn how to translate it into computation languages such as Octave or MAtlab . Warning : the course is fast - paced and requires some intermediate level on calculus , programming and algebra . You will be able to pass the course even if you are not pro at that but it will be hard !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
I still think that there is a lot to learn . the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to . If I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better . generally the course is very good for beginners . The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning .####[['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
The first three weeks are totally trivial . I hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called . Maybe good for school students . ) Week 4 is better . I recommend the lecturer to improve the previous weeks and to redistribute some of the contents of week four . Some real - world examples which point out typical mistakes or give useful hints would be welcome in the first three weeks as well .####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['faculty general', 'neutral']]
Brilliant ! I loved it . Every statement is very clear . Just a remark : the contrast between the level of the sound of the music at the beginning and that of the voice of the lecturer is too big , actually the voice level is not sufficient , I think . I ' m looking forward to attempting part 2 of the course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]

Neither statistics nor R was covered in any meaningful way . At the end of the course , you are left with frustration for having to jump through the loops , but no understanding of the principles . I am a college instructor for Statistics , having graduated from a PhD program - even with that background I could not follow the instructor . The course designer never considered the audience , and never identified the goals of this course . The instructor was lost between teaching R and teaching stats , so in the end he did neither .

The course has enhanced my reading experience . Writing in the margins… up till now I have never challenged or asked the writer any questions . This idea has never struck me before , but interacting with texts provides " room " on the page for my conversation with the writer , which is a visual reminder that all texts are part of an ongoing discussion and are not the last word on a given subject .

This course has been very interesting , however I believe that the mix of genre has been somewhat limited . While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists , I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance : picking up litter , photographing it , and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography , unless the artist ' s message is in documenting our ' throw - away ' society and highlighting the importance of ' recycling ' for the benefit of the environment . Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion . The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused . The interviewer ( s ) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist ( s ) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests . My argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE - THE guy who reads ( not teaches ) the course , Justin - Nicholas Toytama is horrendous .

People use Python for many purposes : to make games , build web services , to solve business problems , to work with sensors , drivers and robots . Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work . Python is an incredibly efficient language : your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require . Py4inf and Python explained by C . Servance , is a great developing of the foundations in programming ( first two courses ) that will serve you well for the rest of your life , as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you .

I can only infer that this course ' s target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities . Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples , watching the videos at 2x speed . The course itself is incredibly shallow , even for a survey course , and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors ' own products - - Graphlab Create . You ' ll be much better off taking Andrew Ng ' s course , which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library . The only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matlab .####[['course quality', 'negative']]
Excellent course ! I find this Fundamentals of Graphic Design very useful for everyone not just designer . It does not only provide me with very basic yet very useful knowledge of graphic design but also helped me greatly in practicing certain skills that I never thought I would have .

This is an excellent course for two reasons : first the video lectures are very good , introducing complex concepts in a relatively accessible manner , and second the automated submission system is good at marking your ( well designed ) assignments . What could be better : compared to a traditional ( physical ) course , I miss the notes . It would be very useful if there was some form of notes , either as an informal textbook or cheat - sheets for each lecture . Another improvement would be that in some cases , it ' s possible to ' solve ' the assignments without necessarily understanding them . This is because you are sometimes given ' too many ' hints or the transformation of the existing code to the final form is rather trivial . Overall an excellent course though .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'neutral']]

Good overview for those without management experience . For experienced folks - - probably a good number since this is an Executive Data Science course - - it was pretty basic .

The assignments are not very relevant to what is being taught . Java 7 instead of Java 8 makes things too verbose .

I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well . I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook . However , after taking this course , I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general . My only criticism is that the course still uses an older version of Python which has some differences and can make the learning frustrating if you are not aware of those differences . Granted , with a free textbook for an older version this is a minor issue thus far in the series .####[['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]

The class carries the name of University of Duke and 70 euros are charged , so I think the learners would reasonably expect to see that the teacher puts lots of time to organize the course structure , in order to efficiently give as much as information to the learners within limited time ! For example , I believe nobody would not say that the Week 2 content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained . And this is just one example .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
My condition : a total computer science newbie . This course , as its proclamation , is very suitable for someone like me . It is a condense and delicate course , which means in order to get the skill to build a website , the only thing has to be done is following the steps in the video and finishing the assignment ; and yet every topic in the course , even a line of code , deserves further contemplation .  Why Yakkov does this instead of that ? " is a question I frequently ask myself during the course . In short , this course provide a solid ground for developing skills in web development , and I sincerely recommend it to everyone who ' s interested in this field .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
Can ' t recommend this enough . Professor Covach gives you everything you need as quickly as he can without making it drudgery at all .

Functional Program Design in Scala is one of the best courses for those who want to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications using functional programming concepts . This course is intended to be taken after Functional Programming Principles in Scala . It is a great course for those who want to explore into the functional programming aspect of Computer Science . The concepts are explained lucidly and the assignments are relatively difficult and help the individuals to apply the learnt concepts in an incremental manner . I was really excited on taking this course , and it has lived up to all my expectations from it .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'positive']]
I like this course a lot because it solidified my understanding of regression . I have often read about regression when reading scientific articles however , i never took the time to really investigate the mechanics on how it is done . Thanks to this course i can now appreciate better the journals that i read . Furthermore , the course project for this course was quite interesting , not too hard , and was bit challenging . There was plenty of time to finish the project and some extra time to make it even better than a simple submission that meets the basic requirements of the course .

Lectures and quizzes are okay , assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics . I have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs . However , I do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasks . Programming assignments aren ' t really friendly to Haskell ' s list , and vectors are not available . If you use Haskell , you ' ll be forced to work with arrays or sequences , which are not as nice .####[['presentation quality', 'neutral'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package , but suffers from some problems . The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments . The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky . As a result , every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants , instead of actually learning pandas . I managed to pass this course with ( what I know is ) subpar code , but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments . The course has potential , but as it is now , I will continue this specialisation .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]

This course requires you have a good ability of programming about C . You also know some knowledge about the HTML , JavaScript . The course covers a broad range of software security .

Dr . Severance is great . He introduces you to coding in a way that is non - intimidating and feels completely natural within a couple of weeks .

Tons of value - - for free ! ! I hope in future iterations of this course you could include more tangible tools we can use to help grow our business .

As a business owner myself , this course has shed some light on things I hadn ' t considered - - and offered a more academic approach to business .

This course is really well put together . The lectures are easy to follow and explain all points very clearly .

Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion . The discussion forum does not work as intended . There is too much noise . They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated . It all seems rushed and not rewarding .

So much disjointed information . . . I felt absolutely crushed trying to learn and understand all this . Am waiting for another 8 hours before I can reattempt the quiz . Personally , I feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics ( simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course ) . The logical progression of how to approach different problems - and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the window . If you ' re new to statistics , I suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided . . .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]

Extremely well done videos , Professor Sachs is articulate and clear . The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment . The quiz are not easy , one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5 . However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it ' s a good learning process . It never fails to amaze me how much data we have collected globally and for so long !####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation workload', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking . You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand . Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project , in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project . The quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning . Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences .####[['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['course general', 'neutral']]
Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science . Fast paced course with good supplementary materials . The homework is progressively challenging .

The course was very useful with what knowledge it provides . However , it would be better if there were more hands - on exercises on relevant stuff . The exercises are too easy and boring .

It was not very clear where to access the book , or what readings corresponded to which lectures . Otherwise a great class .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'negative']]
I found the assignments to be sometimes confusing ( i read the description of a question , thought i was supposed to answer several steps at once , only to realise that the tasks would be broken down in muc more detail later ) . Once i figured out the style , it was much easier , and i would be sure to read entire assignment first . Additionally , i sometimes didnt know whether errata notes were relevant to the code i was actually using , or previous offerings of the same course . Overall though , very good ! Thanks !####[['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
A great course in a unique topic . It is very well made with a balance of theory in robotics motion control with practical assignments using the popular language Matlab . However , to enjoy this course thoroughly I think the previous course ( Aerial robotics ) is very necessary . Also , prior experience with MatLab or a patience to pick up Matlab will be very essential to fare through this course smoothly .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'positive']]
These courses on Ancient Life Evolution are best when they discuss how species developed , how they adapted and how they were discovered . The laundry listing of species in some of the lectures was a snooze fest however . It also repeated what was in other lectures for the week . I would have preferred more information on the ecosystem in which the critters dwelled . The Ancient Marine Reptile class did a much better job of presenting this info although it did some laundry listing .####[['material quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'neutral'], ['presentation quality', 'neutral']]
Very good hands - on approach to practical machine learning . However , as the models get more complicated , some of the material isn ' t really explained very well , specially the last module about ' deep learning ' is quite superfluous . I also wish , the course favored providing a bit more mathematical intuition over just graphlab usage . All things aside , if you are really curious about machine learning you should take this course . Be hungry !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]

I have just finished the course . The course professor has used real life cases to link up with the course material which helps students to connect well with the concepts being used . Very useful for those who are getting into project management but have not done any specific certification around project management .

The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality . The assignment questions were often nebulous . This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader .

This is one of the best courses in Coursera . This changes the way you study about a subject regardless of the field that you want to specialise in .

Very interesting subject matter , and I learned a lot . My biggest complaint is that many of the programming exercises have errors in them that haven ' t been fixed , despite this course having been running for years . This always left me wondering if an incorrect output was an error on my part , or an error in the provided code . Still , I thoroughly enjoyed the course as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a foundation in machine learning .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
A very informative and easily understandable course !

A well - designed course that allows me to understand the web development concepts . Each section is clear and flows to the next section .

Only one assignment at the end , so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code ( this seems like a big mistake for any programming course ) . The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes . You can ' t put that as a project on a resume , because you ' re doing 5 % of the work with your hand held through it . Worst of all , the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices , like local variables not being declared ( so that they become global variables , a big no - no ) , spacing being all over the place , etc . JavaScript has a bad reputation , and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad .####[['assignments quantity', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
This course is very interesting , and everything is there should be known to start a business . But basically , it just says to respect everyone and everything . This course lacks some content .

This was a very well structured course . Prof . Scott has delivered wach lecture with great clarity . As introduction course , it had a very good range of topics and models to learn from .

The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R . This being said , I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth ( with further practice ) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery . I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy , and only now ( after completing the course here on Coursera , reading the textbook ( s ) , and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp ) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R . This being said , the course was very well organized , had great examples , and excellent lectures ( although the audio could be clarified by quite a bit using a higher - end microphone , preamp , interface , and affordable audio production software such as Reaper to clarify the voice ) .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Excellent course . If you want to learn the mathematical intuitions behind Lasso , Ridge and general ML concepts , this course breaks them down into details . This is the only course I ' ve found on the many MOOC sites out there that goes into this much depth . One downside is that Coursera lacks support in general , but I do not consider it downside of this course but Coursera ' s .

An extremely well - structured and useful course . As someone who had only syntactical familiarity with Python , this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language . Moreover , the technical knowledge included ( APIs , RegEx , etc ) is highly relevant and practical . Given that it ' s part of an introductory series , the difficulty level of the assignments is understandable . But providing some more rigorous optional assignments can be a welcome addition to the course .

Great course first of all . One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures . The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift , which are really useful , but they are not comprehensive enough . So for most of the students , I believe , will have to do a lot of self - studying to finish the final project . But still , the final project is challenging and interesting . Swift is not a hard language to learn , so after went through all the lectures and read some books on Swift programming , I was able to finish the project .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'positive']]
This continues Dr . Chuck ' s easing into Python . It ' s a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource .

About the only thing I ' d appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quantity', 'negative']]

Decent coverage of the basics , but some of the data , tools and approaches used are out of date by 2 - 3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast - moving social space . For example , they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM . For someone completely new to the social space , this could be a great starter class . Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you ' re current . After grading assignments by other students , it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat : most either didn ' t invest in the assignments or didn ' t understand the materials . While I have found the discussion portions of other MOOCs to be equally interesting to the class material , I didn ' t have that experience in this session .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
Excellent course ! In the first weeks , when the course started out with linear regression , I was very skeptical whether I would learn anything non - trivial here .

I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift . The lessons felt very unstructured , unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn ' t know they were being recorded , this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an " introduction to . . . course . A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming . To summarise , the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]

While this is a great course for introductory programming , I believe that it suffers from its focus on cokeskultpor UI design . The main issue I have with it is that these skills are not easily transferred to real world applications . I think some time spent on a basic introduction to tkinter would be good to help get people started on how to make their own programs . I found that the grading rubrick in particular focused too much on simple UI elements and not enough on making sure that the code was good or that the game even worked . For example , I had one person who had everything in pong perfect except that the score was added when the ball hit the paddle . This meant that the game as whole did not work as expected , but it only cost him 2 marks .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

Aside from week 4 , I found this course to be little more than a commercial for various social analytics programs . Also , there ' s a Google + assignment .

I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class . This class was at it ' s best during the recitals , where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative']]

Excellent overview of Ancient Greek history . Very much enjoyed the lectures with clear explanations of different aspects of Greek political , military and social structure and the differences between the different polis . Reading material was enjoyable as well - - appreciated the opportunity to read , or reread in many cases , Herodotus , Thucydides and Plutarch . The mixtures of readings also gave the opportunity to view different persons and events from different perspectives which was refreshing . I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in Ancient Greece or the beginnings of facets of Western culture .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'positive']]
I undertook this marketing course as a marketer keen to make sure I was up to date and thinking about new ideas . It was a shame redlaser . com is no longer active , however I ' m sure there are other tools , the course content just needs to be updated .

The course material and the instructor ' s lectures are excellent . However the quizzes are programmed incorrectly - - marking wrong answers right and right answers wrong too often .

I really enjoyed this course . Each unit has many small videos so it is easy to break up . The lecturers attempt to make it interesting ( though sometimes they think they ' re funnier than they are ) . Regardless , it covers quite a few topics in a way that ' s very easy to understand .

It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer . Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough . Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit . Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit ' s intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course . Additionally , given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C , a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
Learning How To Learn is a great course for those who aren ' t sure about their learning tactics like I was before I joined .

Dr . Chuck is a genius who can teach anything with so much ease in just 5 - 10 minutes and i have been taking his courses regularly .

Course is good , the reason I ' m giving it a low rating is because it ' s a little redundant with course 3 " Introduction to Meteor . js Development " .

A great introductory level course to Competitive Strategy . Professor Kretschmer does an excellent job of engaging the audience , keeping the content simultaneously light and yet challenging .

I love the course content , and especially peer review assignments . I have one negative feedback for Cheri Alexander course contents for number of things : 1 - Too much repetition . 2 - Very vague examples were used .

Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics , it is definitely just an introductive class . In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material . The following are my notes and suggestions : - - I found the lectures highly redundant , with many unnecessary repetitions - - using a vector notation ( like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters ) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable - - too much hand writing on the slides while talking : a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable - - very very poor video editing ( many times it ' s clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut ! ! ) - the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology , which would be more correct and easier to understand . Just realize that ML is basically applied math , and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]

This is a great introductory course . The course materials are carefully organized , to avoid lengthy mathematical content , yet conveying the key idea of machine learning . The selection of the topic also seems quite reasonable . This course builds a somewhat solid ground for beginners .

I really do not like the R language I think it is sloppy and inconsistent .

The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching . The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants .

Dr Barbara Fredrickson is an inspirational professor , highly intelligent and calm teacher , and can make you understand and feel relaxed and comfortable with studies . All of the fellow professors were also an important addition to course and presented interesting viewpoints . I highly recommend this to everyone and especially psychology students .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Thank you to everyone involved in making this course happening . The information offered is vital to understanding how we learn . In my opinion I have learned and finally understood important concepts of learning that I should have learned earlier in my life . I am very thankful for being one of the participants in this class and would suggest it to anyone ! Sad that this is not taught in school before we venture out into the world to become a grown up person .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Thank Mark Zupan , and team prepared for the course and interesting material . One star off for the complete lack of feedback in forums and cheating with text material . Neither of the books mentioned in the course , neither pdf nor links where to get or buy . Finally proceed to the third course where , hopefully , we will know how to calculate the required advertising and other tools to gain market power . Why study the specialization I mainly was started####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]

Pros : Basics were explained well . A good kick start for beginners who are travelling towards learning Project planning and management . Cons : Wish we had assignments to practice MS Project to a certain extent . Some of the Quiz questions were confusing ( Esp . the 3rd week quiz )####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
Super funny professor . Not dry or monotonous at all . Mainly talked about pretty basic stuff in this course . But he is really good at explaining things and giving examples .

I am very grateful to faculties for this course , Dr Prasantha Kalitha and his colleagues for such a informative and ultimate course on ' Global PH Losses ' . This course is very important to all learners from developing and developed countries , since world ' s growing population facing acute food shortage , thereby saving losses becomes need of the hour . In fact this is my first time for such online course , but enjoyed the course due to support of all the colleagues in the course . Saving the food is producing the food " and this course will help to accomplish this global goal . Thanks and regards , I liked the course . It really is a true beginners ' class . I think the instructor taught well with good examples illustrating each point . I deducted a point because the exercises were too easy and there weren ' t enough of them . I understand that it ' s not easy to come up with a good grading system , but the grading system definitely could be better .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'neutral']]
Lectures themselves were OK , but presentation needs work . Intro session was very repetitive . Lot of jargon introduced without explanation . Pop - ups w text showed up but disappeared before I was able to finish reading them . Best part of course was actually the text notes at the beginning of each sesssion . A minor nitpick : course description suggests that there are 3 instructors presenting , but I only saw one .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
The course has provided me with a very up - to - date panorama of the current knowledge and considerations over the evalutaion and application of Monitored Natural Attenuation as a remdial option for contaminated sites . It has also explained and commented on many key processes that are involved in attenuation processes , about which the knowledge for those who are participating in the management of a contaminated site is mandatory . Other than that , Drs . Alvarez , Newell and Adamson showed a very good grasp over the topics discussed , with even a few funny and entertaining conversations along the lectures . Overall , an amazing course .####[['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated . For example , it doesn ' t cover the update version of github website and how to use it . That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing . Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment . It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
This course wasn ' t well suited to me , being a person with a programming background . It was too introductory . But that doesn ' t say anything against the course . The reason I don ' t rate the course highly is that it just wasn ' t that coherent . I would have preferred to have a single , consistently good instructor .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class , but I don ' t feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime . The class was challenging , but mostly for the wrong reasons . I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning . It also took me much longer than the 4 - 8 hours per week advertised to complete each week .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
This is a very comprehensive course ( based on my personal experience with Coursera at least ) that goes into relevant detail on the topics it covers , but without wasting time on unnecessary trivialities . The delivery is clear and engaging , so if you ' re interested in the matter , you won ' t get bored . The material covers all the right topics for an up and coming web designer , providing the right amount of information for a confident start and plenty of pointers where and how to expand on the knowledge provided . Another point in favor is the frequent and valuable engagement of the professor and his teaching assistants in the discussion forums , unlike some other courses that feel abandoned by the staff once they start . In closing , I ' ve checked out several web design courses on Coursera and if you can choose only one , this one would definitely be my pick from all the ones I enrolled in .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive']]
This course covers a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace . It ' s not going to teach every aspect of the subjects covered - it couldn ' t possibly do so in the time - - but it teaches enough to allow students to ask the right questions later . I would like to see more searching practical exercises to cement the learning . The existing assignments follow quite closely the worked examples which means those coding along with Dr chuck aren ' t going to have too much more to do .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments quantity', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
Course was great . I completed it at my own pace and enjoyed most subjects covered thoroughly . My favourite week was about Metaethics . I enjoyed it greatly and am continuing studying that in my spare time .

I was sitting behind a proxy server while taking the whole course , I had to get connected to other network without proxy to perform many assignment . It took me some time to realize that urllib can handle proxy server simple by setting an environmental variable . It would be better if Dr .

I enjoyed this course very much . This has helped me understanding many basic things about food and what is important for my kids . There are many little helpful tips . As a working mother with 2 little kids , it ' s so much better to have seen these videos of " simple cooking " , than watching cook shows in TV that make cooking so complicated ( by learning nothing ) and tiring .

For a beginner , this course was a challenge in comparison to the other three base parts of Craft of Writing , but as a result of the challenge , it is by far the most rewarding as well . The concepts discussed , and the material provides the learners with both broad perspective into several topics that I would argue to be crucial in becoming a writer , and also a deep look at some very key concepts to writing . I would recommend taking this course last of the four , before beginning the Capstone project - if you ' re planning on going through all the parts . If you ' re a more seasoned writer , I would recommend starting with this course , and seeing how you fare with it . I ' ve enjoyed all of the base courses , but for me personally , this one struck the strongest chord .####[['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course . Being a true beginner w / no background in programming or data science , I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises ( which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate ) and lectures . I spent 8 - 12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in . I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
Really solid analysis from Trump ' s top economic advisor . I point that out as a warning before you start , but it was really and truly a useful and well - taught course . I highly recommend it .

As an Iraqi student I have to give huge thanks Yaakov Chainkin . He is enthusiastic and explains the materials very good . I hoped to know more about navigation bars , anything else was amazing .

Great course , it is refreshing to revisit topic in psychology with a different perspective . I like that Professor Seamon demonstrates various phenomena associated with Hollywood films .

It has been a memorable experience ! I thought that I knew all about Rock ' n ' Roll until I was introduced to the course that was put together by University of Rochester ! Well I was wrong !

As a total beginner , not only in Python , but programming as well , I found this course to be extremely helpful .

I really liked this course . I have owned and trained dogs from a very early time in my life . I found it very interesting how dogs evolved from wolves and how that is apparent in dogs today . I typically like courses to be heavy on the science side , but this class was well presented for mid - level people or people who don ' t have a science background . Of course people will disagree with some of the material but overall it was an interesting class and the book recommended for the class was a good read .

You can ' t introduce yourself to someone if you don ' t know who you are . This course does such a wonderful job of helping you accumulate the best of you , so that you can then present it to the rest of the world ( more specifically in this case , your interviewers . ) There are some lessons on English pronunciation , which I found a touch tedious since I ' m a native speaker , but it ' s nothing that takes away from the overall class .

Very good course nice practical approach . I was kind of surprised that hierarchical clustering was kept at the end and discussed only marginally since it is a widely used approach .

An enlightening course . Opens my mind to a wide vista of new ways of thinking and living . Practical with seemingly endless tools for the mind . Prof .

I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation . Also , the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete . This is good because if what the activity desn ' t really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you ' ve learned . However , as I ' ve said , if what you ' re being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn ' t all that practical . I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you ' ve learned and whether you ' ve retained the information or not .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
I find this course so helpful , i taught a lot of new skills and concepts .

I never had a programming class that covers really the base of the basics in such a deep and easy to understand way , not taking for granted many things . Professor Charles Severance has a great sense of humour ( it looks like you are talking to him in person it ' s not something spectacular for the camera ) and very generous showing his team , amplifying knowledge through interviewing many interesting people . Exercises were very helpful to understand the chapters . Would appreciate if could have more exercises ( not for grade , but for practicing ) .

The content of the course is extremely useful for young emerging scientists like myself ; however , the videos were very hard to follow because the team speaks fast and with a very strong French accent . The materials are well - prepared , but my attention kept drifting away from the content due to language impairment . Also , some of the introductory notes were lacking proper grammar and I believe that , in a course with such a theme , this is simply unacceptable . With a bit of work , I think this can be a very useful tool in writing scientific papers !####[['material quality', 'conflict'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
I worked really hard on this course , but was stymied by a couple of quizzes . If I could not answer one question correctly , it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions , meaning that I could not pass quiz . With no recourse , I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing . I would still like to pass , as I feel that I really earned the certificate . I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions .

The course is excellent . The platform has some aspects not so good - some parts still don ' t show up as ' done ' , so the progress line is always wrong . Also , the platform is not structured for a course consisting of a number of courses in series , leaving the dates etc wrong . Chapter 1 and 2 should ideally show up as completed , as theey are repeated in every module ( which is fine , but the platform should take care of those members who have done these in a previous module ?####[['course general', 'positive']]
This is a really hard course for an intermediate player . But it is an outstanding course , and it is amazing , if you think about it , to have hours of free access to Gary Burton .

Some of the materials are strictly by sound , so if you can ' t follow chord changes you might be lost . That said , this course helped me improve my playing in several ways .

I enjoyed this course immensely ! I was a bit hesitant due to its length , however , the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting . A couple of the weeks , the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry . Also , I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation . I feel as though I didn ' t really understand those concepts until watching that week ' s as well as the next week ' s lectures . Finally , the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn ' t match well to what the instructors actually said .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation workload', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative']]
From the basic layout of the course you would assume it ' s for beginners since it covers step - by - step instructions to install software and run command on command line window . But on the other hand , many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction . I remember in one class , " data dredging " is discussed for about 2 - 3 minutes . But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is , instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind , you would run the risk of data dredging . I think the course could be organized in a better way . But I do appreciate the instructors ' hard work of putting up such a 10 - course specialization .####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking . Rating on a 1 - 5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems , as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews . I hope it can be improved in the future !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'neutral']]

I am not connecting to the instructor at all . The material is well managed and organized but I am not able to really hear or understand . Further , my connection to the site is disturbing .

There are no notes for the course and the structure is quite loose . There are no assignments besides a final app .

If you ' ve never had a course using Xcode , this will be a steep - learning curve . it May be called Foundations to Business But it is way rich in content and i do appreciate . looking forward to the next programme . i will sure enroll .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quantity', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['presentation workload', 'neutral'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
I enjoyed the contents and homeworks . Overall the delivery was very good , and I have grasped a lot . The main reason that I won ' t give 5 stars is the program assignment . I have spent and wasted 3 weeks to work on the tools , yes , tools , not the subject matter . Course should clearly indicate that the assignment only works in Linux / UNIX environment , and need to further test the scripts in most popular Linux OS platforms , different c + + versions , and different python versions .####[['assignments quality', 'conflict'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
First time taking a programming course . I was able to understand the basic concepts of python codding and I am looking forward to the next course Python Data Structures .

Thanks Prof Chuck and CTA ' s .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Great lectures . I really enjoy discovering the world of the teacher and friends . I ' ll give it 3 stars since it doesn ' t arrive at an awe inspiring conclusion or life changing experience as somebody interesting into these subject would expect .

I felt this course was fantastic - and it is my opinion that the course should be a requirement for all members of the US Senate and House of Representatives - as they might make less dumb decisions when pedalling democracy in Muslim countries .

I found this course had a lot of insights . I have gone from one thing to another but this course is the realdeal . It explains things an easy understandable format .

The lectures are a very brief overview of topics , with nothing actually taught . The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages . This course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to UPenn , Coursera , and everyone involved . It ' s clear that the instructors don ' t care about student ' s actually learning anything . Compare this to the " Underactuated Robotics " course on EdX .####[['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['faculty value', 'negative']]
Excellent and well - structured course that provides learners with the key and simply - explained information about the EU , its history , institutions , policy - making , civic engagement instruments , opportunities that are available to all of us thanks to the EU , and so much more ! For me it was very interesting to watch interviews with people whose work is closely connected with the EU ; these videos are absolutely inspiring . Quizzes are designed just right I think they cover the most essential facts one need to know about the EU ) , and peer - graded assignments touch upon some thought - provoking issues and stimulate students ' critical thinking .

Very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information . Easy and quick to do food demonstrations , basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand . Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks , but I guess that is what she wants to stress on .

With this on - line education , I learned how much health information impacts consumers . Healthcare consumers actively explore health information and make decisions about their health . And they get information via a number of resources such as friends and family , printing , electronic media , health care providers , other consumers and so on . It is very important that health information should be accessible to people and medical staff directly related to patients , and I think that the process of health information delivery should be appropriate to the degree of need of acquiring personal information of medical consumers . In addition , I think that the problem which critical to challenge was examined as long as consumers , providers , and information scientists who develop using health information should go through .####[['course general', 'positive']]
Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch . Otherwise than that , the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching . I highly recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about game theory !####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
This is an excellent course ! Emily Fox does an excellent job at explaining what could be a hard concept grasp . I am talking about convex optimization and the LASSO solution .

Nice course ! It is definitely a beginner ' s course , and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course . I really think there should be an option for people who aren ' t absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and / or do the capstone . After all , this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science , which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners . For what it is , though , namely a very beginning level course to teach the concepts of programming with Python , it ' s very well executed .####[['course general', 'positive']]

I ' d say this was a pretty good introduction to Chinese . The main thing this accomplished for me was practicing the tones , which are very challenging .

A little basic for me . But it was mentioned this was meant for the absolute beginner . Nonetheless , as a developer that never dabbled in HTML , this dipped my curiosity for HTML5 .

Even if it seems too easy .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'conflict']]
Unlike the previous course in this sequence , this course provided little to no substantial information . While I fully agree with the premise of the course , the importance of leadership communication through storytelling , this course presented no sources , psychological research , or evidence to defend its arguments .

Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures . I ' d placed in the " advance beginner " or " intermediate low " level , therefore , you need to have previous knowledge of Python . As in College , lectures and assignments are somewhat related , but you will spend some additional time investigating by yourself to get the appropriate responses . Again , just like College where Lectures are level 2 - 3 but assignments are level 7 - 8 ( out of 10 ) .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'neutral'], ['assignments relatability', 'neutral'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
Beware this course , especially if you are new to this area ( despite what the course / specialization says ) . There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course , but what ' s worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos , so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments / projects satisfactorily or smoothly . I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn ' t paid for this specialization . Beware .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]

Great course ! Goes over proper statistical inference and its interpretation from multiple perspectives . The hands - on R exercises are invaluable .

A lot of material is presented here which is both good and bad .

The only complaint I have about this course is the horribly irritating music at the beginning of each lecture video . I would have my headphones in , volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly , then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly .

PLEASE consider changing this , as it will affect my decision to pursue further courses in this specialization####[['presentation quality', 'conflict'], ['course quality', 'negative']]
This course was really excellent in comparison to many of the other courses in this specialization due to Professor Gavin Brown ' s use of metaphor and analogy to make more complicated content clear and Dr .

I rate this 3 / 5 because of how accurate it looks .

I entered this course with no coding experience , and I can definitely say I am disadvantaged because of it . The lectures are great explanations of the different commands in R , and the projects are a great playground of R ' s different capabilities , but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures . That being said , this course ' s difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programming . Overall , I do not enjoy this course - mainly because it is very difficult . However , the course is structured logically and provides ( what I assume the majority of students ) a comprehensive introduction to R .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'conflict'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course general', 'conflict'], ['course quality', 'positive']]

Unacceptable assignments length ! The reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload .

The content and the assignment were of high quality and I really enjoyed the case I had to work on . So overal the course was very good , but negative was that the course was a bit too long I understand Coursera needs to finance the course , so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees .

- - - - - - - - - way too much time is devoted to introducing definitions and way too little time is given for student practicing and review . the presenter ' s accent is constantly impeding instant recognition of what he ' s saying . the subtitles sometimes don ' t accurately represent what he ' s saying . sometimes there are misspellings - which makes it even harder to know what he ' s saying . this student was inundated with formulas that needed to be practiced - and i didn ' t even have time to write them down !####[['course general', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]

Excellent lectures , let down by the difficulty of the assignments . While the tutors clearly know their stuff , I found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new ( to me ) mathematics or CS that also needed to be grasped . I ' m an experienced professional programmer with the EPFL ' FP in Scala ' and FRP courses under my belt so I thought I knew what to expect but this was much more time consuming than I ' d thought .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]

I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week . Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard . Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand . Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment . Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn . Thank you .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
I am getting started on Machine learning journey . I am happy and very grateful to have found this and started with this course . It provided me overall perspective on various machine learning algorithms and their possible application areas .

Thank you Andrew Ng for setting me up for furthering my skills in this field .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
This course feels a lot like it ' s being taught by a non - teaching professor . The lectures are very long , not chunked for easy viewing ( to the point where I couldn ' t download to my phone for offline / off - wifi use ) . There are very long locally - hosted readings ( so they ' re hard to print and you can ' t add them to an offline reader app ) , and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography ( rather than actual reading assignments ) , because there are no links and some refer to " Selections " without giving page numbers or , in at least one case , a multi - volume book . The information is comprehensive and very valuable , but the delivery is very lacking as a MOOC .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['presentation quantity', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
The course is well structured and quite informative . Instructors bring in real life situations to use different tenses , this is helpful for the learners as it is relatable . The only draw back is that our work is corrected by the other learners and that correction is final . I scored 98 % in the final assignment as the other learners assessed it and they didn ' t give me the correct score . I wish I could appeal to re - check it !####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help . There are also quirks that aren ' t mentioned that other students have to point out . Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation . Feels rushed and it ' s hard to learn for a beginner . Feels like you ' re just going through the motions and copy and pasting code .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative']]
Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not . I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I ' m a boring old sod !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'conflict'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'neutral']]
I took this course with a special interest on the musical aspect , namely the blues , of course . In that regard the course is very superficial , but has some interesting stuff even so . The other aspects of literature , painting , and the more popular arts ( kilts , oral traditions , etc . ) where a nice surprise . This course gives a view of a cultural aspect of America that is very interesting and mostly unknown , particularly , I guess , to a non American . I advise this course to anyone who is interested in ethnology , folklore and popular art and music and is not already familiarized with the American South .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive']]

I sincerely enjoyed this course . The instructor was clear , concise , and obviously passionate about the subject matter . I appreciate that reading materials were complimentary to the videos .

A five - week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans . The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system , differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music , biological interpretation of scales , and the impact of cultural differences onto music . The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education . Its real subject is certain topics in biology , not music . Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student , and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'neutral']]

I found the course informative , interesting and well presented , with two exceptions : a . There was some use of profession - specific terminology / jargon , which is problematic when addressing a target audience from outside the same profession . b . It is repeatedly stated in the course that no two interventions are done the same , and yet only one intervention simulation is used . I would have liked to see multiple simulations covering a range of possible interactions , to afford a more comprehensive understanding of survivor reactions and appropriate intervention responses . All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found myself eager , at the end of each lesson , to get stuck into the next .####[['course quality', 'conflict'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste . All in all , it is a pity , that professor Ng does not offer a corresponding specialization . I would enroll immediately .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'negative']]

A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python . I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures .

In short presentations , Doug manages to give insightful tools to crafting a fine - tuned poem . He makes learning about rhyme , metaphor and scansion uncomplicated while he hones your focus , so your writing can surprise you . The class exercises and community feedback help create a classroom of learners . I was inspired . For the first time I understood iambic pentameter , trochees and scansion .

I loved that there were discrete chunks of learning in this course . All to often one is bombarded with data and can ' t make any sense from it .

In fact , I have enjoyed all the University of Alberta courses offered on reptiles , birds , dinosaurs , etc .####[['course general', 'positive']]
Loved this course . The lecture videos were very clear , well framed , loved the white background and the instructor was always looking at the camera . The animated illustrations provided made the lecture extremely fun to watch and a lot easier to understand . Barry is an excellent presenter , well spoken , fun , pleasant and speaks in a welcoming tone . What I loved about this course is the nature of the assignments which stressed the point of actually doing negotiations with other classmates , it forced me to interact with complete strangers from different countries and review the work of others , which was an immensely pleasant experience . great . thx to dr oakley for wonderful videos n i liked her style of teaching . always with a smiling face !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive']]

There is absolutely no supervision on this course . My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so , no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as ' late submission ' . I have reviewed 7 papers ( requirement of 3 ) and am shown as being deficient . It is as if I dropped into a void . I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution , questions or help . I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative']]
I ' m graduated in System Analysis , not Computer Sciences , and learned to program only by experience . After 20 years it ' s a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me . I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why , or talk in asymptotic notations . Now I can . I didn ' t stop here , I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures . It ' s being a great experience and I only wish I could have more time to keep myself always enrolled in some course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Exceeded my expectations about how much I would be able to learn and develop about the subject , the Law . Completing this course made me extremely and surprisingly grateful with myself and thankful to the Prof . Ayres . Learning during this course were a wonderful experience , and learning more than you thought you would do is a feeling like " a searching for happiness " .

A very enjoyable , engaging course which touches on the fundamentals of Linguistics .

A good course , giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy , their issues and opportunities . I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date . It really needs to be re - done . The Paris Agreement wasn ' t mentioned , some of the research is from the early 2000s , many of the lectures are at least 3 years old .

Definitely a " must - take " course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces . The programming assignments may require a learning curve for those who have never used a Matlab / Octave environment , especially using the vectorized operations instead of loops but that is also well worth the time and effort . If you check question - and - answer sites on the Internet , you will probably find that this is the most recommended beginning course for related branches of science and engineering .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'positive']]
As a current medical student , Medical Neuroscience here on Coursera really equipped me to perform well in my studies in our school ' s neuro course .

A truly fantastic course . Extremely useful , practical , relevant content and examples , plus such a great teacher as well as very helpful course staff and other students . Thanks Andrew , team and the rest of the students . For anyone considering doing the course , note that the time requirements can be a lot - the lectures are fine but two or three of the assignments took far more than 3 hours ( if you plan on actually battling through the coding this is relevant . I ' d highly recommend that anyone considering doing the course does the assignments since this is where the real magic happens - Andrew quite deviously leaves a bit of the theory to be fully worked out by yourself in the assignments ) .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'neutral'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'neutral']]

For a long time , a dreamt with this kind of course and this level of teaching . I believe that this course represents the magna opus of what Coursera ' s mission fosters to be .

A bit lost sometimes . The course was remodeled after previous ones obviously and it seems a little chaotic sometimes . Not sure to get all the message that was intended to be passed .

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that . The reason I am ranking this 2 stars is that I felt the quizzes were unreasonably difficult ( or perhaps they had bugs ) . Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn ' t figure out what the correct answer was . Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared . I have taken multiple coursera classes ( Astronomy , Astrobiology , Calculus ) and these are by far the most difficult quizes I have encountered .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quantity', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]

The testing in this course is horribly crafted . Not is it only too easy thus not actually testing students what is learned , the answers for some of the questions are incorrect .

Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate .

The topic is interesting , the course content is presented clearly , and the lectures are informative . While the assignments can be challenging , they really help to reenforce the lessons .

The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science . At times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting . Will share these observations widely . We are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can .

This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning . I would have given it 5 stars , but towards the end , I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier .

This is an excellent code for both beginners and novice programmers who want to improve their problem - solving skills . This course does not only teach the languages but also teaches the best ways to approach a problem , and how to implement our approach into coding . I have learned various image editing techniques , gained domain knowledge and even built my own full website . The only downside is that the javascript libraries which is used in most of the exercises is written by Duke itself so I ' m not sure if I ' ll be able to use them outside the course .

I tried other complex Unity3d courses online , and this one beats them all in the way it is built stage by stage . It doesn ' t pile too much information from the start , and lets you use pre - generated complex assests first , and only later explains them gradually . Even though I had some basic tutorial in Unity3d I couldn ' t imagine getting that far within a month , investing only about 3 - 4 hours on the lectures . The projects themselves consume as much time as you want / have to put into , with at least 3 - 4 hours on average , but if you want to really learn and improve your skill , it requires a lot more than that .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'positive']]
This course is absolutely awesome ! During 4 weeks I realized that there ' s no such fun as making games in the world ! Also with the help of modern tools ( like Unity game engine ) it is very easy even for the beginners . You only have to focus on your ideas and the engine will take care of all the physics , visualization and interaction . It ' s absolutely amazing ! Thank ' s to Brian Winn and all the comunity !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I enjoyed this course very much . However , I miss feedback ! Maybe it ' s because I did the free course and did not pay . But , sometimes I still don ' t understand why I did something wrong .

This course gives a good overview of GIS . It helps in becoming familiar with ArcGIS software and also teaches a lot of fundamentals that can be generally applied to different GIS products as well . But looking at the expenses of using ArcGIS for commercial purposes , it would have been great had there been some sort of additional , optional demonstrations of other products . . For a small - medium business , ArcGIS doesn ' t seem viable at all .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Very responsible teachers and practical classes content . You can not only learning the ML theory from scratch , but also learn to implement the algorithm using python by yourself .

You have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and I didn ' t think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that . I had to do a lot of googling to figure out how to do stuff on my own . All of the assessments are done by the people in the course and I thought people were a little too harsh . If someone is completely new to AI then it is a bit much to expect the infographic to be magazine quality .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral']]
I really enjoyed this class . I would say that it is a lot of work in a short period of time . Also there were some issues with the peer review process . For example not knowing the criteria we would be graded on before submitting the assignments , many students unable to get enough reviews to move forward especially if they had to revise their assignment . Hopefully , this will be worked out for future versions . Overall , it was an interesting process .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
Although better than the previous course , it still was not very insightful . I wanted to know the components of the Integrated plan and not how someone was successful . Majority of the class was just copy from Stokes book . You can take that book and learn it yourself . The style of teaching does not really challenge or give insight .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
The videos for this course seemed to be 30 % recap of the prior lesson , and 20 % restatement of what was learned . Some even duplicated their own content in the restatement . The material covered was simply running through each of the menus in Tableau . Again , this material may be of use , but would be better as a primer for the class rather than presented as useful , paid content . Terribly disappointed .####[['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['material relatability', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
A quick warm up course for new learner in R . I spent a week to went through the course material and most of the experiment / programming tasks . Now feel quite comfortable to basic R . The course might be improved if more time are spent on some concrete case studies . Some useful functions / routines like str , csv header preprocessing are very handy and it is great to learn these . The last part , debug and profile seem not big concerns for new learners .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
I didn ' t like this course as much . Mostly because the peer reviews were strict and unforgiving and as an experienced , essay writer , I didn ' t feel I needed the rigid , boring academic structure required for this assignment .

The course provides a sizeable amount of pretty cohesive material , which can still be understood by non - CS students . It ' s very practical and it includes a very nice mix of quiz tests and great MATLAB / Octave programming assignments . After going through the assignments I started wondering about other problems which data sets I can plug with small modifications into the completed solutions . Andrew Ng keeps a great balance between explaining important details and skipping over parts that require straying too much from the main topic of the lecture . I still don ' t have very deep or broad knowledge in the Machine Learning domain , but it feels like the course doesn ' t miss anything of the fundamentals . Overall , I ' d definitely recommend the course to CS students , high - school students with interests in the computer science area and even specialists in other areas with some knowledge in linear algebra with interest in the AI and ML domains .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
The video classes are informative and very clear . The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace . My only problem were the auto - graded exams . Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto - grader isn ' t intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting . Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors .####[['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'conflict'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'positive']]

I really enjoyed the course . I think the pace of the course was a bit fast but I could catch up with the lecturer because I was mostly familiar with the concepts .

Great course . Opened my mind to it ' s secrets ! ! Love it . It helped a great deal . Thanks .####[['course general', 'positive']]
The problems are interesting , the course is great . However , the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well - defined , which makes it really difficult to solve ( especially the dataset problem ) . The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple , but is not applicable to a large set of problems , only to the particular dataset that is given ( and the characteristics of this dataset is not given ; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset , which makes the problem more difficult ) . The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly . However , I really appreciate the whole courses , and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses !

Professor Severance is awesome . I really like how each video is an in - depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when . I think his sense of what ' s important is spot on as I ' ve already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects , the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter . The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned . I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week ' s material , especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more . I think more chapters on this in the book could be very helpful though .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['material relatability', 'neutral']]

The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures . This was a little unfair .

We are getting basic ideas , but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly , with NO examples / limited examples , which is what will teach us the most . Then , we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and it ' s very difficult . Instead , too much time spent on videos of " role playing " - just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them . Furthermore , the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the time . The visuals are the best part of the course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral'], ['presentation workload', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
This is a creat course . It gives hands - on practical knowledge and material one can use straight away to generate ideas and solution . It shows , how each one is creative , in a different way .

Very well designed and thought through . A lot of information that you can continue to develop by yourself .

This is a fantastic course ! While the content is reasonably technical , it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience .

I have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to ! it ' s a good course , helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english . The only problem that i find whit this course isn ' t about the course it ' s about the peer to peer grading , is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes , not in all cases . Also is a short course , the assignments are very simple and that makes it an easy going course , i would recommend it for intermmediate english stundents .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral']]

Great course ! Easy to follow , useful , and very practical . At the same time , if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and / or the math behind it , the lectures give you good directions to look further into it . The programming assignments are a bit on the basic side ( in terms of what you have to do vs what they give you ) , but are still great to put these ideas into a practical setting , and the optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth .

Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge .

Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful , when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn ' t place any emphasis into it . So for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all . Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like " Eat3D " and many others out there , which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here !

Great course to explain the fundamentals of Project Finance summarizing key concepts and including some brief examples . Professor Gatti is clearly knowledgeable about the topic and takes great care of being both accurate and synthetic . Course syllabus is also well structured to progressively build an understanding of PF .

This course is not for beginner programmers . You should have some background on programming ( as a whole ) , you should know object oriented programming concepts and if you want to make the most out of it , I recommend that you have a little knowledge on HTML , CSS and on how the web processes requests ( when you access a website for instance ) . That aside , this course is a great way to learn the basics of both Ruby and Ruby on Rails . I have experience programming on PHP using the web framework Laravel .

Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months . I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace .####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory . However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery . There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor , who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to . A couple of math notations were also incorrect , for example " < " when the professor said " less than or equal to " . Overall though , I ' m pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study . excellent course ! they teach you all the terms and sentences you need to know either as a beginner learning Korean or if you ' re planning to travel there .

This was a good overview of the services Google Cloud Platform offers . There were a few bugs with the quizzes , but overall it was put together well and had a lot of information for a short course . I think it is a good introductory - level course for a person who has some background in Data Science and cloud computing , but not much experience with Google Cloud Platform . The tutorials and exercises are quick walk - throughs that can be completed in 10 - 15 minutes each . They give you a feel for how the Google Cloud APIs work and what some of the capabilities are , but don ' t go into much depth . This is an ideal course for a person who is considering using Google Cloud Platform but isn ' t sure what the advantages and capabilities are .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'conflict']]

The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python . That being said , the lectures were absolutely useless .

Nice course , hometasks are about medium level difficulty ( in hackerrank terms ) . Problems are already half - completed , so you ' re just filling the gaps following the design .

Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else . I have now started using Lynda instead , and am seeing all the bad habits I ' ve picked up and the holes left in my knowledge . Normally I prefer Lynda to Coursera for the assignments and the quizzes , but not in this case . . .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative']]
Excellent course for beginners of students aspiring data analytics as a career . It teaches us the fundamentals of R programming language with utmost clarity and challenging assignments .

Excellent material . It could have been better if the tracking problem had more examples showing practical application .

The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice . There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with , yet this is a pivotal point in education . The course assumes that Education is a way to change behaviour ( as an external factor ) Yet I am more inclined to the philosophy of : Education is to lift man up from the animal state ; and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world ( internal factor ) . The theory and practice given in this course are still valuable though , regardless of this difference in viewpoint .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course value', 'positive']]

Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about . Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam , its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind . Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic . Some questions on quizzes weren ' t explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week . Other than that , a solid course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material workload', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]

Great course , really covered so many details ! I really enjoyed this one . This course , together with an intro course , is what I ' ve been really expecting from this specialization .

I have enjoyed every second of the five - part creative writing specialization . These courses have made me reassess my writing practices , they have allowed me to hone my skills as both a writer and working on the editing process . The course materials were brilliantly developed to support the aspiring writer and the knowledge and writing tips are of a very high caliber . Each guest writer and tutor have given great insight into the writing process and how every writer is different , everybody has their own methods of working . Superb and challenging .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I think this course gives me the most fundamental knowledge of photography , which consists of many new words and ideas .

The most terrible course I have ever seen in my life and on this site . For some of quiz questions , you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lectures and quizzes .

I learned a lot of useful information in this course - - my first on Coursera - - and I ' m really excited to see how I will apply the things I learned here in real projects . Although I think that it would be beneficial if the course also required us to submit our code ( not just watch and read ) and also explain github at least a little , I feel that I am well - primed now to acquire more knowledge of how to make apps in the future . I positively adored the instructor ( his accent and way of explanation made it so fun ) . Thanks , Clement ! is a excellent course , I´m a neurosurgeon and I think Dr .

I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned " alternative " approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly .

The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data . The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code . The auto - grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect . The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data , the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer . Admittedly , I feel this effort forced me to become a better Python programmer .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
Good course . Personally I think it is almost the perfect level for those who have some basic understandings about finance and look forward to go deep ( such as me ) .

Some material might be a little hard but with patience and hardworking , it can still be solved .

Through this course , I learned about working and long - term memory mechanisms .

Some parts are needed more clarification . In other words , as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials , since the materials are not self - sufficient . Specially about simulation methods . However , this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5 . The absence of any help from TAs , based on my experience , is the reason . I expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course .####[['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'neutral'], ['faculty response', 'negative']]

This is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning . It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course . I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentational style of the instructor .

As I recall the original Introduction to Python Dr . Chuck course which debuted 3 to 4 years back or so , was split into two . So this is is like the 2nd part of the original course ( split into 2 as it was deemed slightly overwhelming for beginners ) .

This course wasn ' t good . Many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written , and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them . The assignments also weren ' t very deep or imaginative , and some of them requested very specific answers relying in keywords from the lectures rather than ensuring that the students had really understood the concepts .

Not up to the standard of the previous two courses . The material was already covered in the first course - Fundamentals of Graphic Design - and nothing new was brought to the table . Even the assignments were a re - hash of the ones from the first course .

I ' ve tried the Python course of Rice university , and some part of the Codecademy Python course ! This is much more basic and offer a fundamental view about all programming language not only just python . Compared to the Rice University course , this one is more for a new beginner who hasn ' t done any coding before . The Rice course doesn ' t really need any coding exp , but with the projects get more complicated in the end , it would be much easier if you have somewhat coding exp before , at least in my opinion .

This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented .

This is a great course that is very informative . It brought many performers to my attention that I had not heard of before or that I had not appreciated before and has enriched my appreciation of music . The course focuses mainly on the history and development of rock music , rather than the technical side of the music itself . It is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music , but does not feature the music itself .

I definitely recommend to anyone interested in python programming to consider take this course with Dr Chuck . It starts from the basic and become a bit challenging and it is enjoyable whiles you start projecting in ways to use it . I am looking forward to continue learning and be prepared to apply it in my work . Thank you Dr Chuck , the way you teach and interest to integrate student from around the world is very much appreciated .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]

Excellent course and I really enjoyed the learning process I had been guiding through these weeks . This is a great entry level course for people like me who have few knowledge about HTML , CSS and JavaScript . The professor went through each concepts explicitly . Some concepts in JavaScript can be tricky for students without a CS background , but this course really makes things easier to understand . There are some small challenging in assignments , but it ' s still a great opportunity to transform all those concepts to my knowledge and experiences .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'neutral'], ['assignments quality', 'positive']]
It ' s a very fundamental machine learning class .

Andrew takes the time to clearly explain the concepts . Most quizzes and programming assignments helped reinforce your understanding of these topics . I had taken a few ML courses before this but this was by far the best one I had . A must for anyone new to this topic . I wish he did a follow up of this into deep learning and so on .####[['faculty general', 'neutral'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
So far this is a fascinating subject . I know nothing about politics and only have undergraduate work and I love this class . Anyone interested in politics , even with the lack of knowledge I had should take this course . Thank you Yale University and Coursera####[['course general', 'positive']]
This is a great class so far . I am enjoying taking a new look at dogs . It has been especially interesting looking at my dogs in a new way and applying what I have learned .

I hope to be able to take more classes from Duke University .####[['course general', 'positive']]
I am Jun Qi , a Ph . D . student in the department of Electrical Engineering at University of Washington .

This is a great introduction to a more formal approach to algorithms and I look forward to the rest of the courses in the specialization . The dynamic programming week was somewhat more difficult than the other weeks , but I think that could be remedied with more visualizations during the lectures . If you ' re lacking in any basic maths skills , I would recommend running through Khan academy first . Functional notation and series would be especially useful .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'neutral'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]

Excellent course ! Just what I needed to get back into the academic mindset before going back to school . The readings are lengthy and difficult , but it ' s worth it .

I found the material well - organized and explained throughout the course . Lots of learning options ( video , textbook , on - line labs , and Sylvius ) made it possible for me to adapt my learning style as needed to complete each of the 13 weeks . I really appreciate Dr . Len ' s enthusiasm for his subject , and the great support of his teaching assistants . It is a challenging course , but if you are willing to put in the effort , you will be amazed at what you have learned by the time you take your finals .

Really interesting thesis about the impetus behind the formation of the Hebrew Bible . Makes a convincing case by linking the historical , geographical , archaeological , and textual evidence .

This course has been an eye opener for me , I truly enjoyed it . It gives you basic knowledge of what it takes to be a good public speaker , and you can apply this knowledge not only in presentations , but also in your daily life .

Amazing class ! Learned a lot ! Starts from beginning and you end with information to build your own machine learning solutions ! Recommended !####[['course general', 'positive']]
Could be better . The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way , and not always shows how to do in practice . But you will get curious and in case of doubts , you can find more simple explanations on the web , and the forum is very good . The assignments are hard , you will need do research to accomplish then , but is the best way to learn . I think the specialization is good to someone without much knowledge on the field ( like me ) . But it ' s only the start !####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]

The information in the course was really excellent and was set up in a way that it wasn ' t overwhelming . I wish I could give four and a half only because some of the videos explaining procedures were really long and were obsolete , and also because different parts of the site would say that I needed to submit something and others would say that everything was received so it made me really nervous - at one point the site was telling me that I was late in submitted my work and that I ' d need to sign up for a later class but it turns out my assignments had been submitted and graded before the cut off time so that alert just really frazzled me if anything .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

Very poor teaching . Extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested , and what is not . They assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught .

A solid course that delivers what it promises - - the foundations of everyday leadership . As someone who is in their 10th year of leading an organization , I took this class as part of the specialization because I want to make certain I ' m keeping my skills fresh .

The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes , as they are primarily theory and background . The lectures will not , however , aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments . The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures , the textbook , or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment / quiz . There are so many disparate concepts , that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least , demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R . How to properly import the data , create the file , structure the data , and then perform some analysis . These concepts are introduced throughout the course , but never brought together in one complete project .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'conflict'], ['assignments quality', 'positive']]

The " Soul Beliefs " course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias . If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down , they partially succeeded . Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak . A better title for the course would be " why there is no soul " . That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative']]

The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented . I feel like I learned a lot . However , the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level , and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures . I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material , but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme .

I would advise anyone doing this specialization , to take the Java for Android first , then do the Engineering Maintainable Android apps , as its only in the Engineering Maintainable Android apps that there is an optional coursework to create and test a very simple app for the first time . All the other MOOCs optional courseworks start from very complex pre - existing app examples . I was able to complete these courseworks but I didnt really understand all the surrounding code that did a lot of important UI stuff , or the JUnit test . Its good to be forced to make a simple app and get used to JUnit from day 1 . I did not take this route , but I wish I had .####[['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]
It is an interesting course . I would say this course expects more from students than other courses . It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas .

I really feel I have learnt a lot from this course and I look forward to implementing some of their techniques . Dr Oakley was particularly good .

I found Dr Senjowski somewhat harder to learn from .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
Very well made , great contents . The only reason I removed a star is it seemed to me there was more topics in the quizes than in the course itself in the first part .

Otherwise , I enjoyed the class and learned a gread deal .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
The video materials were very poor , they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief . The course only contained a single project , which although fun , is not enough for learning a new language . After completing this course I feel that I don ' t really know Swift , but I can use it . After each week you have to complete a quiz . They should replace these quizzes with project , where you write real code .

Thank you so much for this course , I really enjoyed it ! I only gave 4 stars because sometimes it is really hard to understand , especially key words ( I am not talking about the accent but the group and family latin names , etc ) ; I constantly had to check the subtitles for these .

I am working as an organisational consultant and thought this would add some knowledge - however it is really difficult to follow because it seems repetitive to me . I have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus . It seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again . I got bored by the time I got to week 3 and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments . I hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate . . .####[['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance . Such as real financial close considerations in developed and emerging markets , early stage sub performance and restructuring as well as refinancing . I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects . There were highlights on impacts of Basel on long tenor financing , but more market considerations of new players and structures would have been invaluable .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive']]

This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization .

Thank you to the instructors and the university ! A very interesting course that not only focuses on the content and quality of Scandinavian TV and movie productions but also on the broader ( institutional and cultural ) framework in which they are produced . I would have rated it 4 . 5 starts if possible , but as halves are not possible I give it 4 . Possible improvements : - the delivery of the course can be a bit livier , smoother ; some instructors seem a bit at unease with this format - while an interest in Scandinavian movies and TV series is an implicit prerequisite for a course like this , sometimes simply mentioning ' lists ' of directors , movies , series you might never have heard of can make it a bit overwhelming , hard to relate to - students ' engagement could be enhanced with more interactive assignments####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'conflict'], ['faculty general', 'neutral'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
This course is a very good refresher of the basics and Dr Whiteman has explained things very clearly and precisely .

Outside of the necessary downloads , recordings , playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear . Position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the Instructor did a commendable job elaborating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvise . The reason not a 5 is that the grading is cumbersome and time - consuming to set up####[['presentation quality', 'conflict'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site ! I found that the lecturers sometimes used random terminology without ever explaining it for example , " tags " is another word for sequencing reads , but this is only ever used in RNA - seq methodology , and then only rarely ) . Also , the final peer reviewed project isn ' t explained very well and uses tools and methods that aren ' t even within the scope of the module . Mostly just a waste of time .####[['course value', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
I really want to take moment to appreciate the careful designing of course material . Start from basic and touched every major point of programming . At least we can take this knowledge ahead and use this in more real world scenario . This has given me enough encouragement to stay connected for future guidance .

Very encouraging and challenging with lot of learning on the way . Dr . Vijay and his colleagues have made this course sufficient in information and resources required for the course .

The University of London is amazing . As a person with severe anxiety who is also a full time student I don ' t have as much time as I would like to focus on these courses but this course was so well compartmentalized and polished that it was a great experience even for me . I really liked how the pace of the assignments is increasing in complexity at a very nice pace . As a person with anxiety peer reviewed assignments can be a very frustrating process people can be petty with peer reviewed assignments I can ' t convey to them my other learning disabilities .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'conflict']]
This was one of my first online courses and I think the lecturers did an excellent job of conveying the material especially through this medium . They were also quick to respond to any questions that I had about lectures . I loved the material they presented as well . Great Course . I would definitely recommend it .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step - by - step . The subtitles / transcripts are a disappointment : ( . Full of mistakes . Sometimes to the point of being useless or even worse - saying the exact of opposite of what the lecturer says . Since the lecturer sometimes is unclear - this is problematic . As usual - Graphlab Create sometimes crashes , however there are explanations how to run the assignments using Scikit - Learn .####[['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
Course was informative and well - paced . The videos were superbly recorded and points explained . It is suitable for students in school as well as adults trying to learn something new which can be quite hard at their age . A fresh perspective or insight into learning is always beneficial and this course can either surprise you or completely change the way you learn . Worth a try !####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course value', 'positive']]
The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents . Affirmations are most times not justified at all ( " incremental prototyping will yield a feature - rich and robust software " ) . The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before . The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here . I know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material , but clearly that last effort for quality was not done .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
Simply : this is the single best and most important course of learning I have ever done . Not only has it inspired and uplifted me , it has given me real and concrete methods and techniques for becoming a much better student ( of life ! ) . For all people of all ages , backgrounds and interests I tell you : take the opportunity to do this course and you will not look back . I wish I had this course when I started university ; it should be compulsory material for learners and students everywhere . In short , this course is OUTSTANDING .

It is a great course for introduction about identifying social entrepreneurship opportunities . They show you some organizations , what they do , how they were created and so on through interviews . They also provide links and interseting documents where you can get additional information . It is also good because you can interact with other students , their projects and ideas . I miss a few things like giving you tools and social business plans but I believe that they will come in the next courses .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['material relatability', 'positive']]
Unlike the very first course for beginners , there is a little bit more content here , so I put 2 stars . However , I still found the pace was too slow , with too much distraction ( " funny " videos , teacher drinking and making mistakes , hummm ! ! ! ) . It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses , not 5 ( with the capstone ) . I am planning to move forward with Python , and to keep reading the booklet which is good ( I like the introduction about the HTTP , XML , JSON and SQL databases ) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation , it is overpriced for what it is ! !####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
This is a very interesting course that helps you to understand how an image can be read and interpreted . The focus is very much on the veracity of photography and on the decisioning process which goes through the process of taking pictures . I really enjoyed studying for this course . However , I would expect something more in terms of revision of the final assignment . I would expect some feedback also in order to understand if my reasonings were correct .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative']]

This course should be taken by EVERY 1st year teacher once they are in the classroom or before they step into their own classroom . I ' m positive that this course will help you and will guide you through some of the toughest situations .

This course was truly an excellent way to learn about Einstein ' s Special Theory of Relativity . The content covered most of the main aspects of Special Relativity , and the instructor did a top notch job of explaining how the various aspects of the theory are derived and many implications of the Theory . The maths involved in this course is no more than high - school level algebra with a few tricks , and as such the course should be within most people ' s reach with a bit of effort . Mind you , the concepts themselves are somewhat counter - intuitive , so be prepared to think a lot about the implications . However , all that being said , I highly recommend this course ! It is a very well presented and accessible way to start to grasp Einstein ' s most profound work in his " miracle year " of 1905 .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Loved this class . Perfect level of difficulty for me , engaging videos , and the material provides the right amount of info to get the assignments done without being too obvious . Dr .

Prof . Ng explains everything super clear . He focuses much more on conceptual understanding than detailed mathematical derivations . All the MATLAB / Octave exercises are interesting and relevant . The best part is that all the peripheral coding is provided and one only needs to focus on implementing machine learning related core functions .

Great course to attend ! It allowed me to discover machine learning algorithms and to see I use some variant of those algorithms in other mathematical problems in my job and studies . Andrew is a great pedagogue and it was a pleasure to listen his explanations . I did like the fact that there was an emphasis on debugging and improving the performance of algorithms . I am now looking forward to learn more and practice machine learning in the future .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
This course is great . I enjoyed every minute of the lectures and the interviews too . It was very motivating and informative . I learned a lot from it to teach my self and my kids too .

I enjoyed the lectures , but I felt they didnt go into enough details on analysis of sequence data . The final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course ( e . g . the final exam file not being available ) had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course . A fell I now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis .

Dr . Severance put in lot of efforts to make python easy for all the learners . This Course is about the basics of python . If you are a beginner , you will learn a lot of concepts very easily .

Dr . Impey is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of " astronomy " . The slides were clear . The transcripts helped to reinforce the information , although probably done with vocalization software as there are many sentence fragments , homonyms for the actual word , etc . I did not see a date done but I would guess this course was constructed in 2013 - 2014 , so the information is certainly current .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]

I would give this course a 4 . 5 if I could . I liked the course overall , but felt that there could have been more explanations with the answers to the weekly projects . For answers I couldn ' t solve , I had to look at the solutions and back out the correct formula to teach myself sometimes . I thought the videos were very helpful , but sometimes hard to follow since the text being input in the video was hard to see .####[['presentation comprehensiveness', 'conflict'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'neutral']]
The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined . I really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'neutral'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative']]

The course is interesting and might be useful for complete strangers in the world of fitness / physical activity , as it provides some general ideas about implementing activity to one ' s daily life , as well as gives a good understanding on stating achievable goals . For those who have the essential knowledge of all that , the course would be a repetition of the basics . The most useful part seems to be about the goal setting , and that is what I ' d recommend to start with for most students . The course won ' t be useful for fitness \ sports professionals . Follow - up e - mails for many months after the course ends seem to start turning somewhat annoying .

No teaching . Just a guy talking . Do the problem sets for practice . If you need help , pause the videos and try the code out yourself .

Great course . Lot of complicated detail segmented and described in a way that was easy to digest . Thoughts for improvement are with the first few segments . The lessons didn ' t start with the " why " . Why machine learning is used or what problem it solved . I had to google that in order to understand before the course which started with " what " it was . the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe . It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works it ' s clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course ) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done . further to the course timeframe ) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions , which is very strange in a course for coaching . Not the mention video quality that is scary , I could not watch the videos , and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
Wow ! ! ! Great course . Should add Matlab and understanding of basic Calculus to the prerequisites for those not familiar with those concepts . The sidebar videos helped refresh concepts for those of us not in an Engineering program , but have had the material before .

This course has been a wonderful experience . I admit , the instructor ' s accent had me distracted at first . I turned on subtitles and it helped me to follow the material with improved focus ( in spite of the errors in the subtitles ) . I have finished the course and bought two of the instructor ' s books to " relive " this material . It is full of fantastic approaches to problem solving that I am applying at work .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'neutral'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .####[['faculty value', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
Thank you for making me understand the very basics of finance , OMG . Although I prefer Islamic finance ( without interest ) , I wanted to understand how western finance works . The videos are short , to the point , and I would advice anyone to be committed . I like how Coursera sends you emails to remind you , encourage you and motivate you to complete the course . Much respect for the work you put into the technical notes , and for making the concepts as easy to understand as possible !

Really interesting . I knew a bit about the importance of the microbiome but this course has made me more aware of how I can influence my own .

I really appreciate the approach which was taken to present such a delicate topic , but still there are some mistakes which shouldn ' t had happened . Like the year of Einstein ' s death according to common known history is not 1995 . Also , many times , English subtitles are not correct , I have a feeling that machine has done it . Sometimes there is no understanding of content just the closest word to the sound produced was used . In any case , it is worth of my time , I will recommend it . Students are also provides with plenty of additional materials and when one has more time can study####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'conflict'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course value', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'positive']]
I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments . It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors / teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues , especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people . But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues . Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]

Professor Wright tells things simply - and in a straightforward manner , even some of the more complex ideas , he explains eruditely . Prof .

As an introduction to GIS , I thought this was excellent . I do wish it had been more in depth regarding data types , how to integrate ( for example raster data ) the different types .

An excellent course that really does provide you a challenge . Some of the courses I have done on different MOOCs were rather too easy , but this one did push me a lot .

Excellent course , I highly reccomend it ! Passionate John Covach makes it very thrilling and you really learn a lot .

I am only on Week 3 of this course and so far I am thoroughly enjoying it . The videos are informative and well put together .

This course is truly splendid . I don ' t know how I ' ve ever called myself educated before encountering the work of Plato .

A great course to get started with programming in general and with Python in particular . As stated in the abstract , this course is addressed to those who have no experience in programming . However , even if you have some experience but are not familiar with Python ( as it was my case ) , you can take this course quickly ( speed x1 . 50 ) in order to learn the basic sintax of Python and catch up for the following courses in the specialization .

Dog Emotion and Cognition is a clear , well - structured course with some wonderful ' added extras ' that really help round out the MOOC experience .

I have learned a fair amount about my dog , which has been fascinating , but have also learned about dog cognition against a wider species - comparative context , which has strengthened my understanding considerably .

The lecturers try to keep the instructions basic and pedagogical . Pretty good . Everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create . Not so great , I think .

Not a bad course , but it is a python programming class . There are some steeper steps at times if you are not used to python . Support can seem distant if you hit one of these steeper steps .

It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , " What is Love " session clearly depends an individual ' s own view . It contradicts " triangular theory of love " and the lecturer doesn ' t even explain why .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'conflict']]
Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program , especially in a self - directed / self - motivated way . This course taught by Dr . Chuck was broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested , and I could follow along easily , with just the right amount of complexity in the quizzes and chapter exercises , so as not to discourage me . I ' ve tried to learn computer programming using Java ( inside & outside of a tertiary environment ) with very limited success , but switched to learning python because it seemed more intuitive .

Assignments The words and terms used in the lecture are very simple .

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well . I just wish I didn ' t have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open - ended questions .####[['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'conflict'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
I enjoyed the course , but I the scripting part was still mainly , " here ' s a script to add to the game , and then we ' ll look it over " . There was very little scripting until the project , which really didn ' t require much scripting either .

Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well .

In this course , I see the future of education .

Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help . I ' m sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course , but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience .####[['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]

This class ' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course . The teachers , while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields , fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon . I ' m not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren ' t used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them . As someone who was taking this class without that advantage , I was quickly lost among all the jargon , to the point where I just had to stop .

It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience . Other than swirl , it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before .

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing .

This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism . Yes , the assignments require immersing oneself in problems that have little to do with parallelism per se . But they are interesting , fun , and of course they nicely illustrate the concepts that are being imparted .

Very good course on an introduction to Meteor . js . The course is a nice speed and flows well . It would be nice if there were more assignments in the weeks 1 - 3 .

While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project , I didn ' t feel like the assignment ' s requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series . As someone who bought this course as one large pack ( four courses , one capstone project ) , it would ' ve been nice to see more intersection . I felt a little " in the dark " on some of this . Given the short timeline to finish the work , too , many of these requests need more time ( e . g . building personas needs user research , ideally ) . All in all , a good challenge to a content professional , but don ' t expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Firstly Peter Clarke , what a legend ! ! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2 . I owe you a virtual beer . One change would be to make the forums the same format as course 1 - 3 as this was a much more efficient way to review issues .

Very helpful and inspiring course . Dr . McGarrity with a great sense of humor give all the support needed to get over your fears , to stand up in front of a lens , and to deliver a self - confidence speech .

Highly recommended MOOC .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I enjoyed this class to the fullest ! It was very organized and user friendly !

This was a great introductory course . I particularly appreciated the text book chapter being included as it was a really useful resource . Compared to some other Coursera courses ( quantitative and qualitative research methods ) there were many fewer lectures and resources . That ' s why I rated it a 4 / 5 .

Very well taught and complete introduction to Unity3d and Game Development . I ' m a Unity developer since 2010 and i can say this course covers all the topics in a nice and clean , structured way .

Definitely suggested to everybody .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
Very good course , but I did ' t like how the last week focused on test taking . The course should focus more on ' learning how to learn , ' not how to ace a test . In that regard , I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults . Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively ?####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'conflict']]
This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit . I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall . The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall . i . e . questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'neutral']]
Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language . I would also like to have more tests / exercises with feedback , probably some review tests covering previous lessons .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
It was an interesting insight . Especially for beginners I would recommend it .

The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created . I did learn a bit of high level concepts , but when it comes to coding , the answers is always ' conveniently , my software does this for you ' . I wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper , and implement them . I also was able to complete this 6 week paid course in a few days which should not be possible .

Good course , gave it four rather than five starts because : The discussion boards were too prescriptive which did not lead to any open discussions . The videos referred to course material that was not always there . On the plus side , I found the course material useful and well structured .

The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening . For an institution like the host institution , this is odd .

Great ! This is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student .

The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

The course was very fruitful .

Outdated materials , theory is taught and then praxis is tested . Course needs an update to materials and either teach AND test theory , or teach AND test praxis .

Wayne comes across as very enthusiastic and likable . The course material is interesting . It does feel like the course if artificially stretched out a bit too long , though .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'negative']]

The quizzes aren ' t that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more . i love this program . it has developed me more on how to approach a subject or course . . kudos to Dr . Barbara Oakley . . . u are a good teacher one of the best courses I ever learned , each topic explained very thoroughly . I liked the dictionary section and file section very much . guess tuples are easy , but are underdogs , they can be game changers in next lessons . Thank you Dr .

I feel robbed . I did not get any feedback on my work . Only a classmate gave their ok " yes , there is something written " . I did not follow the course to get a " certificate " but to learn and to revceive feedback . If you don ' t have a special purpose for the certificate - don ' t pay a cent for this .####[['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
Excellent class , and an even better interface now that it changed to always available . Prof . Noor explains with such clarity that even a 5 year old can learn about DNA . This is my 2nd time taking this class , and I ' ve seen already many positive changes in this 1st week alone . Thank you Coursera , Duke University , all participants in general , and a very special thank you to Prof . Noor , your contagious love for science spreads like wild fire .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
