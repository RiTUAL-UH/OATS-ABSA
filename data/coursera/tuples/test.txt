The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening . For an institution like the host institution , this is odd . I liked the course , but it was not very well organized . Seems like it was for experienced musicians , eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well . Good Course , badly organized .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'negative']]
This course was useful and practical . It had essentially real - world application problems . The instructor elucidates every detail , though you may will face much harder problems on the assignments . This what makes the course more interesting and engaging . I also would recommend it to anyone whose future profession somehow is connected to economics / finance / accounting because these are basic skills . You MUST know them !####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['polarity positive', 'positive']]

Very good course on an introduction to Meteor . js . The course is a nice speed and flows well . It would be nice if there were more assignments in the weeks 1 - 3 .

Outdated materials , theory is taught and then praxis is tested . Course needs an update to materials and either teach AND test theory , or teach AND test praxis . I passed this class by switching sessions multiple times in order to use the time to learn the practical skills in data visualization I needed to pass the tests .

Very good course , but I did ' t like how the last week focused on test taking . The course should focus more on ' learning how to learn , ' not how to ace a test .

Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded . That was a sour point to the overall positive structure of the course .####[['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'positive']]

Some profs are very good , some are terrible . The terrible ones need to improve their teaching skills and even language skills .

This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera . I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic regression and neural networks as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon . I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video . Professor Ang explains the material very clearly . I always walked away feeling that any questions I might have were answered completely in the videos or in the discussions .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative']]
Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? !

The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition . The graphics and didactic material is very good . I would suggest that Dr .

This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on . I still made an attempt to watch the course content , but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance .

Aside from that , I was unable to find much value .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'negative']]
If you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them , grab some popcorn and take this course , because , hey , it’s about cool robots ! ! If you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate , I would not recommend to participate in this course . The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about . But there are a bunch of quizzes , which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right .

Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty value', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help . I ' m sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course , but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience .####[['faculty general', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative']]

An excellent course , Dr . Chuck manages to put various things with ease . Material as well as teaching is excellent .

Wayne comes across as very enthusiastic and likable . The course material is interesting . It does feel like the course if artificially stretched out a bit too long , though .

Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization , it ' s a bit of a bait - and - switch .

The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way . The range of technology covered was good and would be useful .

This course has amazing information in the lectures , but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes , you will have to re - take quizzes a number of times , no matter how well you are taking notes .

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well . I just wish I didn ' t have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open - ended questions .####[['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
Would have like to jump straight to the material . Although I understand some may need it , the command line course was pretty basic . This course on it ' s own doesn ' t give much . One can get started with Programming with R w o missing too much .####[['material quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]
This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit . I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall . The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall . i . e . questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'neutral']]
While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project , I didn ' t feel like the assignment ' s requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series . As someone who bought this course as one large pack ( four courses , one capstone project ) , it would ' ve been nice to see more intersection . I felt a little " in the dark " on some of this . Given the short timeline to finish the work , too , many of these requests need more time ( e . g . building personas needs user research , ideally ) . All in all , a good challenge to a content professional , but don ' t expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
The course gave me an overview of the industry , the types of players in it , different models and strategies that can be applied . Many different types of companies are analyzed . There is a lot of information in it , also interviews with professionals . For me it was very helpful in order to gain understanding of the fashion and luxury industry and where I want to go . Thank you !####[['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I really loved taking this extremely inspiring and informative course . Gary Burton is a fabulous instructor . I learned so much . Really wonderful . Thank you . Lisa Lukas####[['course general', 'positive']]
This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism . Yes , the assignments require immersing oneself in problems that have little to do with parallelism per se . But they are interesting , fun , and of course they nicely illustrate the concepts that are being imparted . Another excellent course by EPFL .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
The content of the course is beautifully organised . I liked the way it was presented . Personally i think every learner should do this . It will certainly help all the beginner and continuing learners . Thanks UC San Diego and coursera .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Very good material and I ' m grateful they provided it . There were many issues with the problem sets : incorrect , unclear , beyond scope of course , placed in wrong order of content . I reported all of these and never got even one response , perhaps because I ' m not a paying customer . I had considered paying for the certificate but the more issues I encountered the more I was relieved not to have paid . But a great course nonetheless .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
Very helpful and inspiring course . Dr . McGarrity with a great sense of humor give all the support needed to get over your fears , to stand up in front of a lens , and to deliver a self - confidence speech . But more important , he gives a great example and guideline on how to prepare it . Highly recommended MOOC .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Great course ! I am new in the field of qualitative research and I am enjoying every lecture here . Gerben is an interesting lecturer . I wish I could attend some of his class in person . I guess it must be difficult to fall asleep in his classes with his expressiveness .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Very interesting course . In my opinion in requires some mathematical background ( e . g . to read mathematical notation ) but more important is logical thinking . Sometimes you ' d have to go an extra mile and find some external materials on particular topic to fully understand it but I ' d say it ' s a good thing . I would recommend that course to anyone who knows that game theory exists but never really had a chance to explore it in more detail .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'neutral']]
Really good course , I recommend it to anyone working in the MENA region as a journalist , or business person . Great presentation of the subject . Professor Afsah ' s teaching style , insights and critical theory approach combined with pragmatic reflections is very enlightening and useful for me as a journalist working in Islamic nations . I like the recap checks mid lesson , that ' s useful , as I ' m working and get tired , so it ' s a good check on my own concentration levels .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Only 2 * because of technical issue that i faced in most of the videos are not loading properly . they will stuck somewhere and only audio will be continuing . so i couldnt finish the course . apart from that teaching is really good . hope you guys work on it to fix it .####[['material quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Programming for Everybody ( Getting Started with Python ) helped me familiarize with basics of python in less than 8 hours I have a programming background ) .

I thoroughly enjoyed this class ! I ' ve completed about 6 courses so far and while I ' ve found all of them very informative this is the first one that I was sorry to see the end . Maybe Professor Waters - Rist and her team could conduct another Osteoarchaeology class introducing techniques not covered in this course . Regardless , great job and thank you so much for allowing me to learn more about this fascinating field !####[['faculty general', 'positive']]
Although it is not yet over , I would like to rate this course . I think the course structure is very good and the contents are very useful . I like the way it works . As well , I would like to thank the instructor , Mr .

Dr Chuck , Databases was a dreaded subject for me . Tried my hands a couple of times and left it alone .

Amazing course ! Chris Impey is a wonderful teacher . The lectures are captivating , but at a level that is appropriate for astronomy beginners . The quizzes are only easy if you were paying attention , and the writing assignments consolidate the material . This course has made me even more interested in the subject and since starting it I have even gone beyond the scope of this course and done my own investigations . Definitely recommended .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive']]
If you are looking a general HTML Course , this is for you . This provide general knowledge to create simple web pages , some basic HTML tags and a few practices .

I enjoyed the course , but I the scripting part was still mainly , " here ' s a script to add to the game , and then we ' ll look it over " . There was very little scripting until the project , which really didn ' t require much scripting either . I recommend adding more ACTUAL scripting , or a new section or course that discusses ACTUAL scripting . Otherwise , I did find it informative . I have a lot more questions , but until I see the final course , I can ' t say whether they ' ll be addressed .####[['course general', 'neutral'], ['course relatability', 'neutral']]
A great course from a Great Professor . I really enjoyed this course and i am kinda sad that is over .

Thank you so much !####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience . Other than swirl , it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before . I worked hard to be able to follow it , but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were , I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it . Disappointing .####[['faculty response', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]

This has been one of the best educational experience I have had and I have had some , Ph . D . , MBA . The best part about this course is that it is impeccably organized and possess timely help to students in need of assistance .

Excellent for absolute beginners ! But , if you have good experience in CSS & JavaScript you might play it at 1 . 5X , it is too informative to be attended by someone who knows even a little it might be boring , then .

If you ' re interested in learning virtual instruction , then this is the course for you .

This course gives general information on the magic of middle ages . However , I wish the course could be arranged in a more logical and coherent way , such as geographical or chronological , which will help to understand and memorize . Material in Week 4 is very confusing . It is hard to get the key points from those materials and what the instructors want to tell me . On the other hand , materials in Week 2 is easy to be understood and reflected in the first written assignment .####[['course general', 'neutral'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'positive']]

It ' s good for undergraduates , and people returning to academia ( say , before starting a Master ' s course ) . It ' s a very short simple introduction . I kind of wish it had more examples of language to use in academic writing , contrasting good and bad examples . Some of the quiz questions and final exam questions need some proofreading . The videos from about week 3 to 4 have poor sound quality , but still understandable .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive']]

Was a little too basic . Would have preferred more flesh ( both implementational and mathematical ) on the bones . I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly " this is for the experts in linear algebra " . Come on ! If one is taking a machine learning course , one can expect more from the students . Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap - dance on the surface of the material .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
Very suitable for new comers of programming . For me who has programming experience for more than 10 years and just want to catch up with the mainstream of programming in Python , it ' s a bit too simple .
