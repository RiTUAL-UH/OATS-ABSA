Highly recommend . A clear , practical and well presented overview of the digital marketing field , with an emphasis on the equal playing field : Kevin makes an effort to provide free resources and tools so that any marketer may use the power of digital analytics unhampered by resource limitations . Which is a good thing because marketers often work with budget constraints . Convincing companies to invest more in marketing , which can be a long term strategy , may not always be easy . The course covers basic concepts , ethics , history as well as practical methods . A very useful addition to my marketing knowledge base , and toolbox .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I did enjoy this course and I get excited every time I click on the new lesson . I am not an I . T professional and my only goal is how to design web that is accessible but I went through far from my goal ! Thank you for this opportunity !####[['course general', 'positive']]
Loved the course but I had to work hard for the grade on this one . The videos were engaging ( and fun , yes , fun ) , making a dry topic like history of ESL teaching a lot more palatable .

I ' ll review 5 star because even tho we are LOTS of people Yaakov and the assistant both take the times to clear our questions on Discussions . Yaakov takes us on an amazing tour for our web client ! His explanations on videos are great and has really taught me not just to code , but to do it as efficiently as possible . This course and Yaakov are amazing !

Thanks to you both ! I found your presentation concise and pleasant . You gave enough examples that I could reference them later on if I needed them , but not so many that it bogged down the pace of the class . I look forward to the next course you produce .

This was a very interesting course . Not what I was expecting when I enrolled , but I enjoyed it completely . I especially liked the lesson on the logical possibility of time travel .

The most valuable insight was at the end . We can be so focused on efficiency of solar conversion that we forget it is not the only factor in producing a useful product . I know this but the specific example embeds the insight to better use it in other situations . Overall the course gave a good overview , though it was a mixture of the very simple ( calculations ) and difficult ( the explanation of the polymers ) that needed more pointers to appropriate further reading . Useful to know that the effect of cell shadowing in the series cells has a small effect on output . I hope the project gets funding to continue the research .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'neutral']]
The professors need to go into more detail with JavaScript . Our assignment required the use of JavaScript but it didn ' t fully explain how to use the code that was shared during our class . I enjoyed the class very much and I loved the challenge of figuring out how to complete the assignments .

I ' m grateful to the professor for constructing and delivering this course . I learned a few things but the lack of musical analysis was a disappointment .

Great course and great teacher . The lectures are quick , easy to understand but nevertheless interesting . The time schedule is tough , but you can easily switch to the next session to have more time . The only aspect that I would change is the technical level of ( some of ) the lectures : sometimes they are even too easy , and a lot of time is used to explain very basic stuff .

An absolutely complete course that teaches about Luxury companies , but mainly about Fashion . There are 2 great teachers that gives contents , but also makes sudents think about future and trends .

Very generic advice although the interviews with children ' s writers were illuminating and helpful . The marking system was inaccurate , for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn ' t ! Good , solid advice about setting character , scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer ' s block . The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience . Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral'], ['course general', 'neutral']]
Brilliant course . Masterfully taught , very well structured course that makes optimal use of the online teaching format , and teaches a lot of actually applicable skills if one ' s willing to put in the effort . I ' m kind of at a loss for superlatives reallyI would say it was pure joy taking the course , but there were at least 10 % frustration about my code not working or my brain refusing to understand some formula or other . Obviously those moments were worth no less , probably much more than the purely enjoyable and interesting ones in terms of knowledge and skills acquired . Anyone who is relatively new to machine learning - this is the perfect crash course introduction .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
Very interesting and enjoyable . There is much to contemplate in this rich dense course . I think I ' ll do it again and extract even more now that I ' ve been through it once . I find the material consistent with my own practice of mindfulness meditation , and with my studies in psychology . Thank you for a wonderful and stimulating experience . I am recommending it to family and friends so we can discuss this matter in greater depth .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material relatability', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
First of all thank you for making the course . I liked the structure of the course and the material covered satisfied what I wanted from an introductory course . I also liked the fact that the course is self paced and one can join at any time . In short good course with interesting examples from the professor . I recommend to anybody who is curious about microeconomics .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'positive']]
The course was challenging , and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures , and a bit more practice on using the basic functions , I learned a lot . I thought the video lectures were a little sparse . There were only 20 - 30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit . More examples in video lectures would have helped . I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture . So overall , the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python ( but moderately experienced in C programming ) , and although I would have liked a bit more guidance , I learned a lot .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'neutral'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral'], ['assignments quantity', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Excellent course ! As close as it comes to a course on the meaning of life . I ' ve learned so much and loved every minute . This course has helped me to know myself a lot better , and to understand others , and the human condition in general . I feel as if it ' s also helped me to solve a couple of life ' s great mysteries , and at the same time introduced me to a lot more great unsolved mysteries . Everyone should do this course ( all three modules ) !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Good course on the whole , learned a lot and enjoyed it , but it would need to be updated and corrected ( certain bits of code don ' t work as they did when the course was produced , which can be pretty confusing ) . Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed , and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful . Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity , keep it up ! Cheers####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative']]
Well , after the regression course , which I actually found interesting , the classification course doesn ' t look so good . The programming assignments are mostly pointless . The use of graphlab doesn ' t make it better . The info presented in this course is rather superficial . If you ' re entirely new to machine learning , you could find some value in this course . If not , go buy a good book .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'conflict']]
It was one of the best courses I have taken so far and the instructor for this course Mr . Yaakov Chaikin is one of the best teachers . This course starts from the very basics and touches even very advanced topics before you even know .

Half way through the course I have already learned so much about learning . It ' s a combination with practical learning skills and theories on neural science .

For me , a really nice combination of1 . a theoretical overview of database and data processing concepts , MapReduce and the most important implementations of the various concepts ( SQL and NoSQL databases ) , 2 . practical application of these concepts in real - world programming exercises . I like the way Bill explains , and I like the exercises - however , to complete those , you need to be ready to learn the technology on your own , the lectures are NOT about learning the technology ( Python programming etc . ) to do the exercises . For me , that ' s fine , but for people who have little or no programming experience it might be frustrating . So , if you like the combined approach of this course , I can really recommend it !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'neutral']]

This course gave a great opportunity to explore one ' s creativity , with assignments that didn ' t require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression . However , I also found that it didn ' t give me the richness of principles and techniques that I ' ve found in other courses in this sequence . I expect that , for an in - person course , this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content . In a peer review situation , the feedback is quite general and so doesn ' t take up the slack from the lectures . I suggest that Coursera work with the instructor to retain the current content , but produce much richer lectures that have concepts and principles which students can put into practice even after the course ends .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty response', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
Very little content on offer other than some short clips and mildly interesting readings .

I am mixed on this class . I like it Ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms .

In terms of Theory for General Software Architecture this Course is a good refresher for a person who is working with Software Architecture already .

Compared to the previous courses in this specialization I found this a tough course . Calculating the big - O for yourself wasn ' t easy .

The last assignment of the course is , compared to the others , more difficult .

I had to analyze the tweet texts for the last graded assignment without using Spark framework ( nor any of the other " Big Data " tools explored in the course ) .

Not a beginner course . You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab . Some of the equations presented don ' t have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied . I have a background in electrical engineering , and I studied control systems in undergrad , so I was able to get by .

I like this course , but for me it was a little bit harder to understand some basic stuff . Ie , in JSON for me was confusing to hear " a list of dictionaries " .

This course is very good at explaining both how and why you would do things a certain way in Unity , something that is missing from most of the tutorials you can find out on the Internet . The professor explains concepts behind why you need to use certain components instead of just giving a list of things to match up to replicate the projects . I ' ve rated it 4 out of 5 stars not based on the content , but because the response time , interaction , and feedback could be improved upon . The content is definitely 5 of 5 . I took this during the first run of the course , so I ' m sure that the course staff will improve on this in the future once they get a bit more used to running a MOOC on Coursera .####[['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'neutral'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
I would not recommend this course . The content is very relevant to the subject matter . However , the lectures are much longer than they need to be , and filled with unnecessary commentary .

If you do not know R studio or R programming this course will be very difficult for you . The fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable . Week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions . Their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer . I ' m very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because I do not have the time to figure out how to program in R .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
Excellent course . Focusses mainly on data analysis in Excel rather that teaching you all excel function . A good way to learn both .

It was really helpful . I have 18 years of software development experience , but never learnt python and after going through this course , I could understand the power of it and how it can be used . I could learn the concepts very well and of course had to google to refresh myself , but its well organized and put together in a way we can learn easier and faster . Thanks to Dr Chuck . Sometimes your comedy was above and beyond , but at the end of the day , it was a good course and learned quite a bit .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
The work load in this course is more intense than the preceding course in the specialization , especially on week 3 . Other than that , I think this was an excellent course .

My congratulations for this course . Was a great experience to learn about this topic and the important for our future . Additionally , i would like to make some suggestions especially related with approach on developed countries , developing countries and the data stat .

Huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed , even if you submit before deadline . Course content is not substantiated with research . Assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned , which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignments from earlier sessions . The person responsible for the course should take the following actions : 1 ) Aligning the grading criteria with the assignment instructions2 ) Clearing out the backlog of assignments that have not yet been peer reviewed . I estimate that there are 50 - 100 still pending review , many were submitted almost one year ago .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

This stage of the course i feel could be summed up to just one week worth of work . It mainly revolves around ZMOT and best marketing analytics and data collection techniques and rawly around 30 minutes of content , and the last week was more of a " let ' s sum up " . Compared to the first stage where every single week had a new subject , with lots of content this one i feel , just didn ' t cut it . I do feel I learned a lot from it . and i plan to finish the specialization , but this one should be aided as part of another another module .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quantity', 'negative']]

Really interesting course and material and a very good instructor . This would be a 5 stars course if it wasn ' t for the final project . During lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known ( which is okay ) .

The most weak part is automatical grading . When structure and semantics are essential , text inside tag is not , guessing if exists space between elements isn ' t acceptable as well . Also it ' s difficult to check when long code snippets should be pasted as plan text in short text field . Better to use file uploading with required snippet . For me also not enough accent was on html 5 features with dedicated examples how use new tags and attributes .####[['grades general', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
This course is literally changing my life . Discovering various tools for learning and figuring out which ones and in which combinations work best for me has been an interesting and fruitful journey . Studying for GRE has become fun for me .

The best course I had on coursera . It is a comprehensive overview of current biotechnological techniquess and their established and potential results . The course keeps a shrewd balance between giving scientific information and looking at the broader more complex implications for society . You might think at times that the professor is not a scientist but a philosopher as well . The course is taught superbly by both professor and assistant , not one extra word , and not one word missing given the choice of topics . I think most of what is taught here should ideally be known by the majority of all people , in order to make more informed and thoughtful choices about life , as well as understanding what will happen in the next decades .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]

A course without almost any prerequisite knowledge requirements . While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks . Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow . Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use , but it ' s somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and " code - hiding " . Still , I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'conflict']]

Highly recommend to take this as your first MOOC course . Very easy to understand , all topics discuss are presented in an easy , painless manner . The professors have very informative and brief video lectures , and taking the questions and quizzes right after the lectures is very helpful in staying engaged without using up too much of your time .

Quick overview of the Arduino platform . Since I was new to Arduino , it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively . The peer - reviewed grading process is something that can be improved . I think the course should have covered some more concepts in detail that are relevant to IoT devices - for example , interrupts and their usage , detailed discussion of the SPI protocol . Also , more elaborate treatment of how to implement security in communication over internet with Arduino would have been great .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'neutral']]
Most of coursera courses I have taken I am not able to complete , it is easy to drop off , not feel engaged , not able to complete the assignments on time . This course had the perfect balance - it had structure easy to follow weeks schedule and quizes . It provided additional reading and articles if needed to dive deeper . It also was a well rounded course with theory , interviews of experienced people from the industry , videos on practical experiments and summarizes of researches done on the field .

Overall this is a really great course . My small criticism : Sometimes I wished for more optional videos containing proofs of the formulas . I often spent all the time watching the videos wondering how we would solve some problem only to be presented with a formula without any explanation where it came from . This is only a small problem because the answer was usually not too hard to find and often even linked in the discussion , but if this information were contained in the course content ( e . g . optional videos assuming some linear algebra background ) , it would be even better .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quantity', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative']]
I really enjoyed the practical part of showing concrete examples and direct applications of Machine Learning algorithms . Instructors are dynamic and have made efforts to show enthusiasm .

I ' ll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing . There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways . The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking . The reason that I ' ve only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework . I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation .

I have met part of my goals of taking this program . Thank you Prof . Mathias Finger . I would recommend it to be more data oriented like those case studies with specific examples so that it naturally converges to creating case study for a city at the end of the course as final project rather than optional study . Also , suggest to reduce discussions centred to challenges ( the course has taken too much of time ) and more towards different new services adopted by different cities to capture benefits / impact to the city GDP .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
This course was difficult to follow and the free trials offered seemed forced upon us . Lexalytics isn ' t available for a Mac , so I couldn ' t even use it . I think this portion of the specialization would be much better if it focused more on the value of these tools rather than trying to get us to install them . It might be useful for some ( especially those in B2C or willing to play around with the tech ) , but it was a waste of time for me . I would have preferred to just take a look at some proven case studies linked to the tools .####[['course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
The course is hard and needs previous knowledge of R . The time for for doing the " quizes " are not long . On the other hand , the questions resemble real world bioinformatics problems .

A very refreshing course that focuses on the character growth of students . Inspires teachers how to teach and practice character that can influence students to practice the same wherever they are .

This course has given me all that I require to further dig in and do the experiments . I right away ordered Arduino and some components from Amazon . Thank you Professor , and thank you Coursera .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Great course ! The assignments are challenging and interesting . The topics are very well explained and take a logical sequence . The power of MATLAB is well presented in this classes . I ' m sure that my programming skills got to a higher level and I ' ve been recommending to all my friends and colleages .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Excellent course . It is a really good overview about Dairy Production and Management . It does not bore with too much detail . However provides enough additional material to work with and get as far into the subject as one wishes to . Thank you so very much for this online course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quantity', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'negative']]
This course was great ! It was also my first MOOC ! It cleared up a lot of the things that were blurry before . I especially enjoyed the Security part , which I deal with tangentially at work and I could never quite grasp the concepts , but now I do . Thank you very much , Dr . Chuck and the team !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I love the professors , but unfortunately , I do not feel much connection to me ( not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements ; I am not an investor , and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements ) . The Managerial Accounting ( week 4 ) transforms my mindset ! ! I really appreciate that . That one single week of course can literally help so many companies / NGOs . That week 4 should be promoted more ! !####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Had a blast doing this course . Mr . Bloom is a great teacher ! Incredibly interesting and insightful resources as well . Makes me wish I could go to Yale !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Excellent course for learning the very basics of Python . The class was well organized and easy to understand . I liked the exercises . They were a bit challenging in the end . My only negative thing to say is that I hope they are able to update the time it takes to grade assignments on the server . I can ' t wait to take the next course !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative']]
Many thanks for this course . I would love it . Materials of the course are were very exactly formulated and understandable . Margaret Meloni made this course as colorful with her melody voice and good explanations . I think i will use knowledge which i got from the course in my future works .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Once again , Prof Chaikin has hit the ball out of the park in terms of design ( very hands - on ! ) of lessons and delivery of content . The painstaking attention to detail , intuition about particular pitfalls for new learners ( and more proficient ones too , in fact ) and of course , the self - deprecating humor all contribute to making this actually pretty advanced course a whole lotta fun ! And yes , like any really good teacher , Yakov feels the need to delve into theoretic niceties that most wouldn ' t . My background is that of an enthusiast programmer . Now I feel I have a good idea of what software engineering is about .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
It was a good course , however , it seems that the recording was from the earlier course . Which I don ' t mind , however , some of the comment wasn ' t relevant , so it was a bit weird . In terms of content and how the course run , it was beyond my expectation . The list of literature provided were quite extesive and strategicaly chosen . I wish there ' s a whole syllabus that we can access in the beginning of the course to prepare for the assignment .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'positive']]
I have taken the non - certification course of Machine Leaning by Dr . Andrew Ng . The material covered is this course is adequate and very insightful . In my opinion this course should be a start point for any individual who want to learn Machine Learning . This course provides all the necessary fundamentals with a little bit of math that gives an intuitive sense of the algorithms . I would gladly recommend this course .####[['material quantity', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
This course could ' ve been better by the inclusion of more examples , the lecturer is very monotonous and sadly i see no discussion forum for this course , in addition to that , whenever i tried replying to the comments the reply button turned grey and nothing happened . I had reported to resolve the issue but nothing happened the issue persists . It could have been done much better specially the lectures . Thank you : )####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quantity', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative']]
I like the content of the course . However , there are some remarks I want to share . For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud . I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future . I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'negative']]
There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters . It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming . Yes , a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot , but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality ! Also , I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there ( documentation , etc . ) could help them . Also , as the students start have to read multiple docs , etc . the time expectations per week should be increased .####[['material quantity', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
Introduction is much more than this course is , in my respectful opinion . When I read the information on the specialized program , I thought it was something more compact , more useful in the face of the video game industry . However , this program of courses is rather a paltry touchdown , an insignificant approach . I think it should be underlined that it is a course for those who have never had any experience in videogames development . Considering all this , is a great course . You have to be objective .####[['material quantity', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]
