Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization , it ' s a bit of a bait - and - switch . Prof Aarabi is an award - winning professor at U of Toronto , but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material . Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he ' s a terrible instructor . I previously took the Android Specialization , which was excellent , so I was shocked at how bad this course was .####[['faculty general', 'conflict'], ['course general', 'negative']]
I enjoyed this course and now feel more confident to tackle subjects that I normally would avoid . The tips and strategies taught in this course will help me to learn more and have less anxiety taking tests . I always have had test anxiety and I think that now that I ' ve learned how to learn I will do better on tests ! Lots of content and a great course for anyone who likes to learn !####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Very useful course to users of English from pre - intermediate level and up . The information is presented in interesting and understandable way . Practice exersises are great , you never get bored . The teachers pay attention to really confusing grammar points . For sure will enroll to the other courses from the university .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? ! In addition , you can ' t participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself . I would prefer to add to a thread than go in blind to each forum####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'conflict'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
This was a very well thought out and well put together course . The instructor was excellent , and I learned new things . I recommend this course even if you have knowledge in the branding industry .

A very interesting experience . I got imagination level - up . Though it was really difficult to understand what should you do in each assignment . I ' ve spent quite a while time to realize what to do each time . And some students did their homework completely wrong .

This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on . I still made an attempt to watch the course content , but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance . Two stars for quality video production . Aside from that , I was unable to find much value .####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty relatability', 'negative']]

The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition . The graphics and didactic material is very good . I would suggest that Dr . Maya improve on her cooking skills ( cutting and chopping ) , It takes too long to do every task and she must use appropriate tools . also , measurements are very important in the kitchen to be disregarded as she does . Remember , she might be teaching to people that have not cook at all . Cooking without measuring is for an expert or a least for somebody with some cooking experience .####[['material quality', 'positive']]
Although it is not yet over , I would like to rate this course . I think the course structure is very good and the contents are very useful . I like the way it works .

Very interesting course . In my opinion in requires some mathematical background ( e . g . to read mathematical notation ) but more important is logical thinking . Sometimes you ' d have to go an extra mile and find some external materials on particular topic to fully understand it but I ' d say it ' s a good thing . I would recommend that course to anyone who knows that game theory exists but never really had a chance to explore it in more detail .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'neutral']]

What a great course . Professor Shiller explains concepts in a simple manner so everyone understands .

I was quite stunned by this course . All key points were structured in a concise and clear manner .

Fantastic course . I ' m not very good at actually completing MOOCs ( something about not having to answer to anyone , I suspect ! ) but the reviewing of classmates ' work was done nicely , enough pressure to mean the assignments actually got done , without requiring an unreasonable amount of time .

Excellent presentation of the material , providing not only the mathematical concepts but the context in which they are used . Definitely taught as well as my best classes at university , and far above the worst .

Awesome . Pure awesome . Great presentation on the theory and all the assignments force you to code solutions from scratch , you ' re not dependent on Graphlab .

Excellent course with practical and fun examples . I ' m eager to try some of it at work ! Many thanks to Andrew Ng : intuition before theory , simple examples , rephrases ideas in different terms , and shows he has a lot of fun teaching this course . I wish I had more teacher like this when I was a student . I wish there would be a follow up with maybe even more tips for large scale machine learning and datasets where the positive class is only a small fraction of all the data available ( not anomaly detection though ) .

This course is the absolute best I have taken on Coursera . The teacher is very engaging , explains with ease is a very friendly professor that guides you effectively as if you weren ' t taking this class online . It is elegantly designed with in - video questions and helpful quizzes that are short and on - point . I liked the over - all design , it touches in the most important thinkers of Sociology but also focuses on aspects that aren ' t always taught in Sociology classes .

I was very impressed with the content of this course .

I appreciate you giving me the tools to help me become more successful .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded . That was a sour point to the overall positive structure of the course .####[['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'positive']]
It has helped me , because I want to be a better student . I ' m studying engineering and I want to do well in my career , but I find it difficult and I think that if I follow the advice of this course , I can do it better . I would also like to improve my English ( I am from Spain ) and practice a little every day with the pomodoro technique .

I thoroughly enjoyed this class ! I ' ve completed about 6 courses so far and while I ' ve found all of them very informative this is the first one that I was sorry to see the end .

Regardless , great job and thank you so much for allowing me to learn more about this fascinating field !####[['faculty general', 'neutral'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'neutral']]
I learned a lot from this course ! I loved how analytical it was and it was great to learn about the historical contexts of gender on the canvas .

Good course , but could be more challenging . For people growing up with the space race it has a lot of interesting video and written material .

This course was carefully programmed and developped by a team directed by Chris Mortensen . It is obvious that he loves horses and the research he does , specially that concerning equine reproduction .

Overall this was a good course . Some of the presenters need to work on their presentation skills ( personally I had no problems with the accents ) . I also felt that the sections on dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed and I needed to spend a bit of time researching this on third parties before I felt comfortable completing the exercises . The grading system was really cool and the exercises seemed well thought - out and thorough . I ' d recommend this course to existing developers without a computer science background . Those who want more mathematical rigour should look into the Tim Roughgarden / Stanford course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'positive']]
The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .####[['presentation quality', 'conflict'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative']]
This course is not as polished as most other courses on coursera . They occasionally give examples that are too small to see in the video . Most of the quizes dealt with syntax . I don ' t feel like any new skill was developed in taking it . If you are interested in iOS programming take the University of California , Irvine versions of this class .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['presentation relatability', 'neutral'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative']]
This is a pretty good intro to Excel course . It gets a little patchy in Weeks 3 and 4 ( it seems like some of the worksheets weren ' t checked for errors ) , but it never wastes your time . It ' s a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonly - used professional functions in Excel . I ' m glad I took it , though I do wish there had been more of a progression . For example , it would have been nice if there was a final , project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in Week 4 .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative']]

To be completely honest , I was expecting more from this course . One big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on , and instead jumps straight into algorithms . This might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code . I , on the other side , have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms , but when Pavel mentions gene expression and transcription I have a very vague idea what he is talking about .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative']]

A great soft start into Python .

This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices . Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student . That being said , a programming newbie should have no problem following it . The professor speaks slower than necessary . 1 . 75x or 2x speeds make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow . In addition , it uses an old version of Python , which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'neutral'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'neutral']]
When I was in a physical classroom I wish I had a Professor like Ed .

This i believe is a very good introduction into Functional programming . This course was a lot harder to what I initially expected .

Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX , it is still very underwhelming . Priced at ¬£39 , the course materials that are spread to 5 weeks could easily be done in 1 or maximum 2 weeks . It is hard to justify that for example " week " 5 consists of a 7mins long video and a simple quiz . . . Week " 4 is 15mins .

While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course .

This course was much more useful than I thought it would be .

Especially good for those who don ' t know anything about programming and could hardly imagine how things done inside this electrical magic box .

Good class , knowledgeable professor . I would have preferred if some of the longer sessions ( closer to 20 minutes ) were split into two sessions . I didn ' t like the conversational style of this course , though , because it felt impersonal . It would have felt more personal to me if it had just been Dr . Fredericks on camera . I thought the session where Kelly Stacks was interviewed was worthwhile and good to include .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quantity', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]

Thanks Professor Hare and Coursera since I do enjoy this amazing course which challenges many stereotypes . For example , dogs evolved from wolves not because of human ' s intentional domestication but due to " self - domestication " 12 - 15000 ago . Also , it is generally regarded that certain breeds of dogs are smarted than other . However , in this course , Professor Hare points out that cognition involves many types of intelligence rather than one and there is even tremendous variation within a dog breed in temperament , behavior and especially cognition . Strongly recommend this course especially when you ca n taste this class with your own dog !####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
The instructor might be a good web developer , but neither she nor anyone else on her team know how to write a parser . Unfortunately , that is exactly what they attempted to do for grading Final Projects . Unless you are ready to suffer through several hours of tearing your hair out because their parser does not accept perfectly written code , don ' t take this course . The only thing you ' ll learn through the experience is that some people should stay as far away from writing autograders as the planet would allow them . Additionally , the information presented in this course is available in several better structured and presented versions both on Coursera and other MOOC platforms . So you don ' t need this course in particular in order to learn the material .####[['faculty general', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['grades general', 'negative']]

The course does a great job of curating very relevant videos and articles to understand digital from a 360 degree perspective . While all of us are exposed to digital from a consumer perspective , looking at it from an entrepreneur ' s and investors ' perspectives completed the picture in my head . I liked the short video format , it is engaging and easier to schedule into our lives . Some of the readings were called " not mandatory " but were needed for answering the quiz ! I would request not to have really long readings - some of them were very intensive papers written as part of an academic exercise and I will be surprised if any of the students , who are looking for many small and engaging materials would be interested in tackling really long non - man####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation workload', 'positive'], ['material relatability', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'neutral'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
This was a very good intro course . Some additions that could be applied may include : describing different types of motions ( interrogatives , cross motions ) ; types of judgments ( proscriptions , summary judgments , enjoinment ) , types of memoranda , or even a FOIA request . Maybe a look into work product privilege , protected documentation , principles of discovery . And finally , a little intro into the art of using case law as an event or test , for example ; in " Miranda " , " Keller " , " Brown " , or the " McDonnell Douglas test " . I understand this is just an intro , but if these things could be fit in somehow that would be cool .####[['course general', 'positive']]
I enjoyed it very much . The professor shared a lot of valuable information and talked a lot about his experiences , and it was very interesting .

Challenging if not a developer and grader needs very specific code . that aside , this was a fun interesting course , great intro to bluemix and Node - red and js .

This has been an exceptional course . I have really enjoyed it as an introductory course to Korean , because it does a good job of teaching the basics without trenching too much in the details . I believe that in beginning stages a learner should not boggle themselves down too much with the details of a language . With time and exposure details are learned . Our instructor was easy to comprehend in her English pronunciation ; she was professional , and she seem to enjoy the topic .

I saw this course recommended by a commenter on hacker news . It is really an amazing course .

It had one great idea after another after another , with lots of information packed tightly in a small space ( moreso since I watched it at 2x with closed captions ) .

A good entry level course on modern and contemporary art . The themed approach works well and the artists are chosen carefully to give a broad overview of the subject .

As others have said , the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials . However , the capstone project was a waste of time . Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me . In addition , the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1 / 3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all . This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses .

In some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in R Programming . That ' s very little value for money .

The course is delivered in a simple manner , easy to follow and with clear instructions .

Superb course - thank you .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
Very good Course ! Just 3 weeks and I have already learned a lot ! Thank you Coursera for this amazing opportunity . I also want to congratulate the teacher Paulo Lemos for being a very good teacher .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
That was excellent . Very easy to understand for non native english . Fulled with ideas and tips . Surely I will harvest many of the teachings later on in my life . Thanks Barbara !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I have really enjoyed doing this course ! ! After graduating from the University I have done nothing with my life , but being a housewife and mother . And now , after 15 years , I think it is time to show the world I am not too old to learn again . Thanks for all the practical learning tips !####[['course general', 'positive']]
Excellent course : Not boring . No introduction by means of elongated manuals . Instead of that : Overview about possibilities . A short presentation of a lot of html - elements on the basis of practical examples . Highly recommended !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive']]
Excellent course . It could be more challenging , but it is still a fun , well - delivered and well - balanced course that benefits the beginner as well as the novice . Dr . Chuck is great and very engaging . Looking forward to the capstone .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'neutral'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'positive']]
The material covered in the course provided a very good introduction to Machine learning algorithms and its applications . The programming assignments were not difficult but interesting and had a lot of scope to play around with . The quizzes were challenging and tested well on the course material . I feel like I can dive deeper into machine learning after taking this course . The advice provided by Prof . Andrew regarding how to approach real - world machine learning problems were very helpful .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I like the course so much . Taking part in it made me experience a different way of films and television , especially made in Scandinavian . I did not know anything about European movies before until I participate in it . It is a memorable experience for me , it led me to a different world about movies and television . Thank you for the course .####[['course general', 'positive']]
There ' s a lot of great information in this course and it ' s presented in a very good way . However , like the excel course in this specialization , most of the material isn ' t about using Tableau . 1 week is about running a project , 2 weeks are about using Tableau , and the final 2 weeks are about presentation . If you ' re interest isn ' t mainly in Tableau , I would recommend the course . However , if you ' re taking this course to learn Tableau , I would suggest not paying for it .####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['material relatability', 'negative']]
I have previous education in programming . This was a good refresher to start programming with again , especially Python - a language I ' m new to . I just wish the interactive Python assignment submission tool would accept both Python 2 and 3 . Otherwise , it ' s pretty great !####[['course general', 'positive']]
This is a highly recommended course and the content is second to no other on Coursera at the time of this review . I have taken all of the courses in the series from Copenhagen Business School , as well as nearly all other business management courses offered for other institutions . This specific course on Strategic Management is the single most informative and current material of all of the options . It does not answer every question or address every concept you would need to know to run a major corporation , but it is a fantastic overview of past and present methods of business strategy , and is of value to any business minded individual . I highly recommend this course and the entire series from CBS . Enjoy !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
GREAT Course ! Thank you Andrew for your excellent videos and thank many other volunteers for your contributions to this wonderful course ! It is a great introduction and overview to machine learning . I feel I learned a lot from it . Hope we could have many other courses like this one on coursera !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
Excellent introduction to Machine Learning . The course is specifically suited for beginners . So If something you read or heard raised your interest in machine learning and wanted to learn it , this is the perfect introductory course for that . It was a pleasure to learn from Andrew Ng . The course uses Octave / Matlab for the programming exercises , but hopefully they will change it to python as it ' s better suited for beginners . Thank you Andrew and thank you to everyone who worked on this inspiring course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral']]
Very professionally created ! The topics are clearly presented and learning is made interesting with creative assignments . I ' ve learned a lot of useful knowledge and skills from this course that I can implement in my work as a teacher . I would recommend the course to anyone who cares about professional development . Thank you : )####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Very informative and interesting course ! The pictures were incredible & made it easy to stay focused and engaged . . I forgot that I was on a computer : ) The interviews with researchers & professionals from different universities , Parks Canada etc . were great learning tools . It opened my eyes to the amount of research being done to protect our mountains and their ecosystems .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive']]
I did this course last year , and consider it to be among the very best I have seen . It is great to have such a diverse group of lecturers , everyone of whom know that material very well ; they are great presenters also . If I had been asked , before I took the course , about summarizing 4 billion years in 10 weeks ( 400 million years per week ) , I ' d have said it was impossible . These guys actually did it , and they did it well ! I like the overlap between lectures , as each lecturer had their own style , and sometimes a topic was covered from two different perspectives , which reinforced my knowledge . I ' m only sorry that I can ' t give this course more than 5 stars !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive']]
What an amazing course ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! At first I skipped this and started R Programming . But then I thought let me just check it once and I am really grateful that I started this . I am looking forward to complete whole specialization####[['course general', 'positive']]
