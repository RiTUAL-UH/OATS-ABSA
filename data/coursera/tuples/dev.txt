A quick warm up course for new learner in R . I spent a week to went through the course material and most of the experiment / programming tasks . Now feel quite comfortable to basic R . The course might be improved if more time are spent on some concrete case studies . Some useful functions / routines like str , csv header preprocessing are very handy and it is great to learn these . The last part , debug and profile seem not big concerns for new learners .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
I really appreciate the approach which was taken to present such a delicate topic , but still there are some mistakes which shouldn ' t had happened . Like the year of Einstein ' s death according to common known history is not 1995 . Also , many times , English subtitles are not correct , I have a feeling that machine has done it . Sometimes there is no understanding of content just the closest word to the sound produced was used . In any case , it is worth of my time , I will recommend it . Students are also provides with plenty of additional materials and when one has more time can study####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'conflict'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course value', 'positive'], ['material quantity', 'positive']]

Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge . Thank you for your effort !####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]

Great Course ! You learn a lot about Unity ; for someone who has never used it before . I ' ve tried to start with Unity from books and tutorials on my own , but I never got as far in the 4 weeks of this course . You make three basic games , which gives you all the basics of Unity . Very well worth taking this course , and the instruction / materials are superior .####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['course value', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Course was informative and well - paced . The videos were superbly recorded and points explained . It is suitable for students in school as well as adults trying to learn something new which can be quite hard at their age . A fresh perspective or insight into learning is always beneficial and this course can either surprise you or completely change the way you learn . Worth a try !####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['course value', 'positive']]
This is a fantastic course ! While the content is reasonably technical , it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience . The Teaching is top notch and the material is communicated in a way that is not only engaging but concise and easy to follow . I have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to ! it ' s a good course , helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english . The only problem that i find whit this course isn ' t about the course it ' s about the peer to peer grading , is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes , not in all cases . Also is a short course , the assignments are very simple and that makes it an easy going course , i would recommend it for intermmediate english stundents .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['material comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['grades general', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'neutral']]

I am Jun Qi , a Ph . D . student in the department of Electrical Engineering at University of Washington . I ever took Carlo ' s excellent machine learning courses at UW and was really feeling pretty good .

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking . Rating on a 1 - 5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems , as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews . I hope it can be improved in the future !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'neutral']]

Beware this course , especially if you are new to this area ( despite what the course / specialization says ) . There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course , but what ' s worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos , so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments / projects satisfactorily or smoothly . I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn ' t paid for this specialization . Beware .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['material quality', 'negative'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science . At times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting . Will share these observations widely . We are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can . When I was taking this course , my city is going through severe flooding and the country is in yellow alert stage due to abnormal thunder storms . You should be ashamed of yourself for pushing this garbage .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative']]

Very well made , great contents . The only reason I removed a star is it seemed to me there was more topics in the quizes than in the course itself in the first part .

Otherwise , I enjoyed the class and learned a gread deal .####[['material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]

I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned " alternative " approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly . I like to get a certificate , but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
I definitely recommend to anyone interested in python programming to consider take this course with Dr Chuck .

A brief but interesting introduction to HTML . Very few practical examples and exercises , but it does cover the basics like : syntax , semantics , what to pay attention to while creating own website . Love the way the material is presented by Mrs . Lent and will finish all three remaining courses . Combined with the HTML & CSS course at CODECADEMY I have the ability to write simple html , read somebody else ' s code and find resources necessary to get me started with my own page .

No teaching . Just a guy talking . Do the problem sets for practice . If you need help , pause the videos and try the code out yourself .

I enjoyed this course . Professor Holbo developed an effective course for a " philosophy - gentile " like myself . I especially like the Lectures 7 and 8 where Professor Holbo compare and contrast Plato ' s philosophies to two modern empirical scientists .

A little basic for me . But it was mentioned this was meant for the absolute beginner . Nonetheless , as a developer that never dabbled in HTML , this dipped my curiosity for HTML5 .

Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate .

Excellent course and I really enjoyed the learning process I had been guiding through these weeks . This is a great entry level course for people like me who have few knowledge about HTML , CSS and JavaScript . The professor went through each concepts explicitly .

The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python . That being said , the lectures were absolutely useless .

This course is a very good refresher of the basics and Dr Whiteman has explained things very clearly and precisely .

The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined .

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that . The reason I am ranking this 2 stars is that I felt the quizzes were unreasonably difficult ( or perhaps they had bugs ) . Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn ' t figure out what the correct answer was . Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared . I have taken multiple coursera classes ( Astronomy , Astrobiology , Calculus ) and these are by far the most difficult quizes I have encountered .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments quantity', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['assignments quality', 'negative'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning . I would have given it 5 stars , but towards the end , I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier .

Recommended !####[['course general', 'conflict'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'negative']]
Unlike the very first course for beginners , there is a little bit more content here , so I put 2 stars . However , I still found the pace was too slow , with too much distraction ( " funny " videos , teacher drinking and making mistakes , hummm ! ! ! ) . It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses , not 5 ( with the capstone ) . I am planning to move forward with Python , and to keep reading the booklet which is good ( I like the introduction about the HTTP , XML , JSON and SQL databases ) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation , it is overpriced for what it is ! !####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'negative']]

I have enjoyed every second of the five - part creative writing specialization .

The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step - by - step . The subtitles / transcripts are a disappointment : ( . Full of mistakes .

I took this course with a special interest on the musical aspect , namely the blues , of course . In that regard the course is very superficial , but has some interesting stuff even so . The other aspects of literature , painting , and the more popular arts ( kilts , oral traditions , etc . ) where a nice surprise . This course gives a view of a cultural aspect of America that is very interesting and mostly unknown , particularly , I guess , to a non American .

Nice course ! Very elaborate and well detailed . Except for some videos that get stuck for some time making the lesson longer , it was a nice course . I also thank you for giving me this opportunity to get a certificate from Amory University which will help me as an EMT - I . Thank You .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'neutral'], ['presentation workload', 'neutral']]
I am getting started on Machine learning journey . I am happy and very grateful to have found this and started with this course . It provided me overall perspective on various machine learning algorithms and their possible application areas . I sure hope to be able to build on this knowledge and be able to apply to real life examples . Thank you Andrew Ng for setting me up for furthering my skills in this field .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
Not a very good course . The assignments are not very clear . Could have done much more like integrating front - end etc in place of that loopback module . Was really disappointed with this one . Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC####[['course general', 'negative'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
This course teaches not only Python and also how to program . This course fits to beginner level in coding . Dr . chucks teaching , content , Coursera interface . quizzez and assignments makes this course enjoyable and happy learning . Thank you very much for wonderful course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive']]
Amazing course ! First I have taken this course to understand the big picture of what is ML . After this excellent course provided by Professor Ng , the clarity of the concepts explained , I now want to do a shift in my career and go deeper in ML . Thanks Professor ! Thanks to Coursera too . I do not if you change the world , but at least , you have changed my world !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week . Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard . Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand . Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment . Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn . Thank you .####[['course general', 'negative'], ['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
This course is awesome . As a current research technologist in this field , this course gives me great knowledge of cancer . I recommend anyone who is interested in this field . However , this course by itself won ' t give you everything . It is a course where you want to begin with if you want to begin a career of this field .####[['course general', 'positive']]

Excellent . Very comprehensive course that has relevance to academic research scientists and those with less scientific training . This is accessible for those with busy schedules and encourages and provides information for further reading on the topics . A very good historical overview but critically with up - to - date recent research developments . The graphics , visualizations , animations and on - site demonstrations work very well . I highly recommend .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
Excellent . . . my knowledge on this topic has grown significantly , it has a logical thread , and have done significant work to make it fun . Excelente . . . mi conocimiento sobre este tema ha crecido de forma importante , tiene un hilo conductor lógico , y han hecho un trabajo importante en hacerlo divertido . gracias totales ! !

A very interesting experience . I got imagination level - up . Though it was really difficult to understand what should you do in each assignment . I ' ve spent quite a while time to realize what to do each time . And some students did their homework completely wrong . But except of that it ' s a great course .####[['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course general', 'positive']]
A bit of a mess . If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups , you will be disappointed . Assignments are good and thought - provoking , but not clearly written . You will get out of the course what you invest in it . Take your assignments seriously and invest a lot of time , even if you know that you are able to pass with a lesser effort .####[['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'negative'], ['course value', 'positive']]
When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great . However , towards the end of the course I found that it got boring and not that stimulating . Maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter .####[['course general', 'neutral'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
The course is really helpful . After learning you will have a general picture on how the brain works ( the diffuse mode and the focus mode ) ( The working memory and the long term memory ) Some basic neuron science ) . . . . . . . . . . I really learned a lot . Thank you Professor Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski . : )####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
What a great course . Professor Shiller explains concepts in a simple manner so everyone understands . He also make a great deal of references to the origins of old concepts such as banks , insurances , etc . so you not only understand the concept but the reasoning behind such concepts . So happy to took the course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
This course is the absolute best I have taken on Coursera . The teacher is very engaging , explains with ease is a very friendly professor that guides you effectively as if you weren ' t taking this class online . It is elegantly designed with in - video questions and helpful quizzes that are short and on - point . I liked the over - all design , it touches in the most important thinkers of Sociology but also focuses on aspects that aren ' t always taught in Sociology classes . A great course !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['course quality', 'positive'], ['presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
It was extremely intriguing and exciting to learn the program modules in such a systematic and comprehensive manner but still retain the fun elements of business and Entrepreneurship . It was gripping right till the end and I did not loose my focus even once . More than anything it was a fun learning experience and I will surely try and be a part of the second leg as well . It was an eye opener for as to how business is done and things are made to look so simple in the module by just having a systematic approach to risk and risk mitigation whilst developing a business . Thank you to all the teaching faculty for this great learning experience .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]
The course is great for beginners into the filed of learning to be reporting . I am happy i signed up for it though it was a bad time at work to focus on the course but I did . I look forward to completing the remaining courses required for specialisation . Thankyou coursera and the Michigan State University for the opportunity .####[['course general', 'positive']]
Dr Chuck is a very good instructor who manage to inject both humor and clarity into his teaching . He got me hooked on Python ! I always look forward to the next lesson .

Thank you ! This course advanced my skills in Korean . I appreciate your efforts and those of your students . I am better not than when I started . 대단히 감사합니다 .####[['course general', 'positive']]
An excellent course . Would specifically recommend this course to the people who are novices in programming and who are new to python . This course will definitely help you appreciate the basics of python and some relevant use cases . A big thank you to Dr . Chuck for creating an excellent course####[['course general', 'positive']]
Firstly Peter Clarke , what a legend ! ! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2 . I owe you a virtual beer . One change would be to make the forums the same format as course 1 - 3 as this was a much more efficient way to review issues . Over all the material was good , I stuck at it even when I wanted to quit and feel knowledgeable now on the lesson taught .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'neutral'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning . The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quizzes and programming assignments ; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it , what I ' m doing wrong , or sometimes I don ' t even know what the question wants me to do . However , with perseverance , I was able to get through every one of them .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
Thank you for the course ! It was challenging in some way and VERY interesting . Besides , it is really stimulating in terms of self - learning as some aspects are mentioned but briefly . Personally I had some trouble with navigation , which made me spent a lot of time browsing the Internet for some information . But as they say no pains , no gains : ) Thank you , Colleen ! Looking forward to CSS course .####[['course quality', 'positive']]
In this course , I see the future of education . It is light years ahead of any other course I ' ve taken on Cousera or EdX , as the instructor has developed a web pedagogy that gives the course the feel of seminar - based instruction at a top - tier brick and mortar institution of higher education . In this course , students become members of a lively learning community that is always on . Please attribute any typos herein to the fact that I ' m typing on a smartphone while riding in a subway car . )####[['course quality', 'positive']]
This was my first experience with HTML5 . I enjoyed and learned so much from this course . Dr . Colleen van Lent is very informative and provided excellent video lectures and valuable assignments . I ' m looking forward to finding more courses from her .####[['faculty general', 'positive'], ['presentation quality', 'positive']]
I enjoyed this course and now feel more confident to tackle subjects that I normally would avoid . The tips and strategies taught in this course will help me to learn more and have less anxiety taking tests . I always have had test anxiety and I think that now that I ' ve learned how to learn I will do better on tests ! Lots of content and a great course for anyone who likes to learn !####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
Fantastic class ! The teachers is organized , charismatic , a respected author of such interesting subject matter . He brings relevant outside writers to interview about their viewpoints . The assignments are clear and really opened my mind to other ways of thinking .

I took this course seriously and worked all the way till the last assignment . As per my experience and understanding the course contents are quite dense , but the lucid and succinct presentation made it quite comprehensible and interesting . I was amazed to find how well the concepts were formulated in a suitable mathematical modelling . I wholeheartedly thank Prof . Ng and the support stuffs for this wonderful course .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created . I did learn a bit of high level concepts , but when it comes to coding , the answers is always ' conveniently , my software does this for you ' . I wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper , and implement them . I also was able to complete this 6 week paid course in a few days which should not be possible . I have since started the free Stanford course taught by a co - founder of coursera , and it is MUCH better ! I recommend it to anyone !####[['faculty response', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
Wonderful lectures and good assignments . Very , very clear presentations . Minor drawbacks : there ' s no assistance available for the assignments ( which can be quite difficult ) . The quizzes require sometimes information that is not directly available in the video lectures . Note that it takes more hrs per week than mentioned ( but it ' s worthwhile ! ) .####[['presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments quality', 'positive'], ['presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['course workload', 'negative']]
I truly adore this course . I ' m an engineering student and my strict class schedule doesn ' t allow me to explore as I ' d like . I ' ve always been interested in Buddhism and I ' m an avid meditator . This course gives me a historical and psychological framework in which to look at my practice .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'positive']]
Very much enjoyed the course , its focus on method and real - world problems / issues . The quality of the instruction , including the technical , graphic support was high and always in evidence . The instructor ' s humor also came through , as well as his upward potential as a dancer .

This course is really nice ! Normal courses are superficial with basic knowledge . I really like the way of researchers introducing their area and talking about the recent related publications .

This class ' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course . The teachers , while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields , fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon . I ' m not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren ' t used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them . As someone who was taking this class without that advantage , I was quickly lost among all the jargon , to the point where I just had to stop . I ' m hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background .####[['presentation quality', 'negative'], ['course general', 'negative']]
课程设计非常合理有趣！老师讲解的很详细，而且真的特别幽默！！虽然报名了好几个课程，但这是我在cousera上完成的第一个！ Although I ' ve registered in several courses in Coursera , this course is the first and the only ( so far ) course that I have finished ! So much fun and I learned a lot ! Thanks Yakkov !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course general', 'positive']]
Fantastic course . I ' m not very good at actually completing MOOCs ( something about not having to answer to anyone , I suspect ! ) but the reviewing of classmates ' work was done nicely , enough pressure to mean the assignments actually got done , without requiring an unreasonable amount of time . Douglas is a fantastic teacher and really inspiring ; the course has revitalised my writing in just the way I needed !####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'positive'], ['faculty general', 'positive']]

Great ! This is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student . It provides a chance for us to study different type of machine learning algorithm . The assignment also gives you a chance to practice these algorithms on some application example . If this course can provide more deeply mathematics algorithm or guideline for future study on learning algorithm , it will be a perfect course !####[['assignments quality', 'positive']]
Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language . I would also like to have more tests / exercises with feedback , probably some review tests covering previous lessons .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['course relatability', 'negative'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['assignments workload', 'negative']]
Good course , gave it four rather than five starts because : The discussion boards were too prescriptive which did not lead to any open discussions . The videos referred to course material that was not always there . On the plus side , I found the course material useful and well structured . The personal journal was an essential part of the course and it should be emphasized as such . Without it I would not have learnt as much .####[['course quality', 'positive'], ['faculty response', 'negative'], ['material relatability', 'negative']]
This is an excellent introduction to Chinese language and grammar . I think it could have some introduction to written Chinese because Pinyin is not so common . I struggled with some of the quizzes where written answers were given , even when my answers were correct some quizzes required stops ( . ) others didn ' t . Apart from that it was excellent .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['assignments comprehensiveness', 'neutral'], ['course comprehensiveness', 'neutral']]
The material in this course is very interesting . I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms . I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry - level manner - it will take some hands - on practice with real datasets to build expertise , understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base . I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming . I completed the Python for Everybody specialization , but still struggled with the programming in this course .####[['course general', 'positive'], ['material quality', 'positive']]
