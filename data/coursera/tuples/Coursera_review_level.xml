		<text>I will strongly recommend &quot; Politics and Economics of International Energy &quot; to anyone working or thinking about working on the energy field . This course is also an asset for those advising policymakers or policy - makers themselves . I have learned so much from this course though the materials and interviews . Yes it was challenging because it is good . I can only say that I am glad I made the decision to take the course .</text>

		<text>I have been having a great experience learning a new area of study with Dr . Ng ' s well - explained and well - guided tutorial . My previous knowledge of multiple regression has been enriched by my exposure to the cost function . I am looking forward to how I would end up with this at the end of this course . So far just great ! Thank you .</text>

		<text>Great introduction course . Unfortunately the Protools free version is very weak and limited . After I finished the course there was no motivation to go ahead with so many limitations in the SW . I can ' t even create more than 3 songs : - Besides that , the ProTools price is too high to buy it for personal use .</text>

		<text>Excellent course ! Very knowledgeable professor , yet easy and pleasant to follow . The programme is well structured and the content approached with some depth ( considering the introductory nature of the course ) . I would have loved to see , though , a focus more on philosophy ( pre - and post - socratic ) , visual arts and the Hellenistic period , as it is most of the times neglected , even in today ' s historical accounts . Hope to see more courses on Classical Studies soon at Coursera .</text>

I felt that some good grammar concepts were introduced , but there were several that I felt were overlooked and could use more explanation . The vocabulary is good and I learned a lot .

Only issue i did not like what that you had to find a partner to negotiate with and I found it a bit difficult to find people in my time zone who spoke good English .

		<text>I thoroughly enjoyed taking part in this course . The modules covered a multitude of diverse branches of philosophy which helped me to broaden my knowledge of the subject overall and the lecturers were incredibly helpful in explaining simply , and with useful examples , new information . The course has further deepened my love for the subject and the platforms of assessment were challenging , but did not feel labourly . I would without a doubt recommend anybody , regardless of former experience of the subject , to partake in this course and I am highly glad to have had the experience .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed Part Two , but not nearly as much as Part One . This change is not due to the professor or the course material ; both are excellent . It is the music itself . I simply do not enjoy most of disco and pop artists like Madonna , Janet Jackson , Brittney etc . I hope I do not sound snobbish ( or sound like my parents ) , but mentioning the Beatles and former mousketeers in the same sentence or course is laughable .</text>

		<text>Thanks for bringing us an excellent program and valuable tools for managers ! Coaching is a key element in the organizations for handling the human resource and lead them to better performance and results that will set the path for the organizational achievement of goals integrating its employees . I´m glad to say that your course is very complete as it is an assorted set of enriching learning elements : video - lessons , quizzes , readings , peer - review assesments , and the suggested activities like interviewing an actual coach - which is a very fulfilling experience in the learning process and one of my favorite activities for it leads you to interact with a real coach . Please keep delivering and developing quality education . I express my sincere and grateful : Thanks !</text>

		<text>This is merely a starter course that gets you acquainted with the basics of ML using Python . I hope to see the instructors cover algorithms in greater detail in the next few courses in the specialization . Also , they focus exclusively on Dato ' s Graphlab - that ' s a worry . I was hoping to be introduced to NumPy , SciPy and other python libraries for ML . They could have at least spent some time demonstrating why they thought Graphlab was a better alternative .</text>

		<text>Great class ! The course and the problem sets are both very interesting and reasonably challenging . My only suggestion is that a few of the problems are difficult to understand . If those questions can be described in more plain English , students can solve the problems faster . Nevertheless , the discussion forum is very helpful since all of my questions have been asked and answered .</text>

		<text>Excellent introduction for the basic understanding of the Machine Learning . Very good , structured , easy to follow and understand course for anyone whose has previous exposure to linear algebra using MATLAB and Octave . The mentors appear to be very active and hence should not be trouble for anyone without very strong background ( read prerequisite like Linear Algebra especially for the assignments ) . The Assignments are self explanatory enough that I did all of them in just 2 - 3 weeks , thanks to my 2 - 3 years of coding in MATLAB and linear algebra . Thanks very much Prof . Ng and the team !</text>

		<text>I always feel exhausted and reluctant to study or learn new things because my previous learning style was ineffective ! This course tell you how to learn effectively and efficiently , with a relax way , easy to understand ( even if your english is not good like me ) , and appliable in any fields . The coaches , Dr . Barbara and Dr . Terrence delivered their lectures as if they were talking to you directly and knew what are your problems during learning , why you have these and how to solve these problems . Each lesson will ask your feedback and I suggest you to fill it . I am really recommend this course to every one , no matter what or who you are , and how old you are !</text>

		<text>Just finished the course &quot; a little bit &quot; ahead of February . Would have been a resounding five - star review but some &quot; mentor &quot; thought it necessary to hijack a thread by a student asking about the necessity of more than one &quot; break &quot; in a while loop to lecture about what constitutes pseudo - code and what does not on a non - assignment question . This didn ' t contribute to the original posters question . Despite that Dr . Chuck ' s courses are always a real pleasure !</text>

		<text>From the Big Bang to Dark EnergyA very interesting survey of the universe from the big bang to the possible future of the universe . Professor Hitoshi Murayama presents the course in a very unassuming and welcoming manner . The idea of dark matter is explained in the problem of galaxy rotation speed , and the idea of dark energy is introduced to explain the strange idea that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate . The idea of discovery of Higgs , dark matter , Cosmic background radiation and atom formation related to the time history of the universe is also introduced . Future telescope / spectroscopic experiments are given in the last lecture , and can be further looked at on the web with more understanding from this course .</text>

		<text>I learned a lot . This is a tough course , quizes are not trivial and the last HW was a huge amount of work . The videos are excellent . The professor goes slow , the visual aides are great and there are several impressive videos of drones doing impressive cool stuff . Only downside is that I would say it ' s harder than advertised . Also , there are some red herrings disguised as hints in the HW write ups that you have to be careful of before going down unnecessary rabbit holes .</text>

		<text>The videos and explanations are very poor . Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script , and everything feels fake . By reading off a script they are forced to &quot; hand - wave &quot; and do not explain concepts covered completely . The only thing I liked about this course were the problem sets , which were interesting to do . Will not buy rest of specialization , feels like this is just a cash cow for UCSD .</text>

		<text>The lecture quality should be dramatically improved . Even at 2x speed , I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos . In the conclusion , Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is &quot; new &quot; , but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist , and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old , even more than a decade in some cases . so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist . I ' ve taken more than 5 coursera classes , and this has been my least satisfying .  . . I do appreciate the introduction this provided , for free , and plan to keep learning in this space , though not in this course sequence .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed the course very much . It was clear , it included the explanation of its basic concepts for anyone who was not familiar with everything , and it came with graphs that backed up many points argued . I certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to start understanding the global financial crisis . What I did not like were last 2 lessons by Secretary Geithner , which I found very general and in contract to the detailed slides of Professor Metrick . Nevertheless , this is a great course .</text>

		<text>The course outline is very good , however the presentation ( especially the slides ) can be monotonous . The usage of various system engineering terminologies and jargon can be intimidating at times . Appreciate the instructors intention of keeping the videos and material very digestible on a weekly basis , I would suggest them to include more case studies and activities , from the professional realm as well . I would also suggest them to bring in the awareness of various tools that are used throughout the systems engineering process . It is still an excellent course and would highly recommend to any engineer out there . very great courseand its me againmy online certificatehttps : / / www . coursera . org / account / accomplishments / specialization / certificate / 9X5VDS8QTGKGhttps : / / www . coursera . org / account / accomplishments / specialization / 9X5VDS8QTGKG</text>

I am thoroughly enjoying the course and understanding about genetics , genetic drift , selection , sweeps , and so many difficult concepts .</text>

		<text>Awesome class . It was very accessible and had some great examples . I would have liked to see a little more asked of the students . It would have been fun to implement some more examples that required the full ML tool box ( cross validation , training ) . I was a little surprised that there were no discussion / examples of tree classifiers or Naive Bayes . It would have been helpful to have a discussion on how to handle categorical features .</text>

		<text>An excellent introduction to the subject for the computing professional . I learned enough basic concepts of investing and fund management to be able to navigate about the literature and I got some good practice in Python , in particular Pandas . I got my hands dirty and now I think that I can throw a passable trading system and this is what I wanted from the course . It is only to be hoped that Part II of the series will be offered sometime in the future or that at least a reading list for this course would be made available .</text>

		<text>The course is a very practical approach to the language . The main goal of it being to help you get by in the country . It ' s title should be Surviving in China 101 . Although misleading for people wanting to learn the language to an extensive level , it ' s definitely a good base to have and to build on . The material is presented in a very accessible manner and the quizzes help you master the key elements acquired within each session . Overall , great class if you plan visiting the country and want to be able to get by without a translator as we all know that not all Chinese natives speak English .</text>

		<text>The best introductory course in ML . Don ' t be afraid of using Octave / Matlab . The syntax is easy to learn and the programming exercises are one of the important part of the course that enhance your understanding to another level . The course covers really important topics in ML and provides extremely practical advises . You can understand most of the concept without strong background in math like linear algebra and calculus .</text>

		<text>While the topic is interesting , the materials are poor and the lectures are not particularly insightful . The slides have several mistakes and typos , which makes you doubt the whole course . The speakers are not engaging and it just looks like no effort was made in preparing this course . Additionally , the materials do not prepare you for the review , and on weeks 2 and 3 ( the hardest ) you don ' t have a chance to review the questions or correct your mistakes . The course really needs some improving !</text>

It is amusing as well and educational . Really liked the videos about the Restaurant Visit and how to talk to a customer and what to expect and how to deal with issues in the process . very good introduction but as i go through the videos and then do the quiz i feel like the material doesn ' t highlight exactly what is needed for the quiz . Maybe i ' m not taking the video lecture as seriously as i should . Something else to reinforce the material cause it seems a bit condensed . thanks for a wonderful course !</text>

		<text>Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !</text>

My biggest issue and why I didn ' t give it 5 stars if the grading is via peer review and this meant a long wait and lots of begging PLUS getting only one word reviews such as great . Not very helpful . I would like a person who is experienced in essay writing to do a review , but I do understand that , by sheer numbers of students , this would be non viable .</text>

		<text>I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn ' t always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted . For a non - specialist , statistics is almost always a struggle , intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at math . I worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all 6 weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam I said to myself enough is enough . I hate being a quitter , but I was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and self - doubt because I just couldn ' t match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the course . Maybe other people are much smarter than I am , but this source was a soul and time killer for me .</text>

		<text>I have been looking for a stats course to unlock further learning . This was it ! I found the pace , content style worked for me to allow me to proceed on other courses . Yes , I ' hated ' stats when younger and feared it . But I am more comfortable and eager to learn more now and put into practice the extensions I am now able to move on to . Thank you .</text>

		<text>The content of this course , like many other courses in coursera is top - notch ! Professor Andrew Ng has unique ability to explain machine learning concepts in a simple and understandable manner . The course structure seems to have been really thought through as at no point did I feel as though I had a gap in knowledge . I would recommend this course to anybody interested in Machine Learning . Dive in , you won ' t regret it .</text>

		<text>This my first machine learning course and I am very satisfied with it . The bottom - up approach really helped me understand how machine learning evolve . I only cannot understand the proper action to do if I have to use data mining application as modern data mining applications provide diverse algorithms . The hands - on coding assignment is the most valuable lesson for me .</text>

		<text>This course doesn ' t have any writing assignments . I appreciated it because it truly did help me understand the ins and outs of citations , which I needed to know in order to continue on with this course . I tend to get lazy and cute incorrectly because I never had the chance to learn how to do it in school . This professor is very understanding and straight to the point . It ' s what I need for this type of course . If you listen to the professor , it ' s no problem to pass the assignments and quizzes . repetitive . long . too academic . unnecessary terms . The instructor voice is annoying after 2 minutes . Blah .</text>

		<text>This is one of the best courses I have ever taken . It is fun and yet , it is very detailed and , yes , it takes a bit more than 2 - 3 hours per week . You will learn much more than using Tableau . You will learn to ask the right questions and you will also learn how to present your data analytics results to the C - suite or whoever asked for it . I highly recommend this to anyone , beginners and experienced business / data analysts . very useful . all the information covered , are pretty much common sense , and yet people do not pay attention to all the little things discussed in this course . well . i had fun listening to the lectures , and will definitely apply the concepts to my daily routine . tnx</text>

		<text>Excellent way to revisit / rethink what it is to learn and how best to go about it . While unquestionably a boon to students , as an adult ( past middle age ) , I took away many important and unexpected tips , techniques , and perspectives . Although I personally had little direct use for the section on Testing , it was still interesting—and I certainly wish I ' d known that material when I was a student . One thing I would have liked to have addressed is how to set up and use self - testing to assist with day - to - day , non - student procedures and learning situations . Both faculty members were engaging and inspired confidence .</text>

		<text>The title says it all . Great overview of the history , technology , and security of internet . From the title and the nature of these lecture type courses I was worried it would be boring , but not with Dr . Chuck : ) He brings all of the concepts down to earth and help us understand them thoroughly at the same time . Highly recommended for everyone , especially non CS majors jumping into programming !</text>

		<text>Dr Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end . This doesn ' t ask too much . It ' s clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session . This course highlights how easy Python is more than anything and that ' s a good thing . Good coding language for beginners . Good course for beginners or novices .</text>

		<text>An amazing course . I wasn ' t expecting much when I enrolled a few weeks ago but the more I studied and watched the lessons I was surprised with so many great tips and resources to understand and become a better learner . I found it funny that there were some techniques that I already use but have never thought on them . I reccomend this course to anyone , either in high school or college , or even as preparation for other courses in Coursera . Why don ' t they teach this in elementary schools ?</text>

		<text>Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .</text>

But all in all , highly recomended .</text>

		<text>The Professor is excellent and very student - friendly , and the course material is very clear . Two issues though : 1 ) List comprehensions should be introduced . They are extremely powerful and should really be introduced at this stage . 2 ) Charging $ 79 for this course seems like poor value for money , specially for a student like me . It doesn ' t go into great detail and the price point for what is a 5 - 6 hour course with simple exercises seems too high .</text>

		<text>This course gives general information on the magic of middle ages . However , I wish the course could be arranged in a more logical and coherent way , such as geographical or chronological , which will help to understand and memorize . Material in Week 4 is very confusing . It is hard to get the key points from those materials and what the instructors want to tell me . On the other hand , materials in Week 2 is easy to be understood and reflected in the first written assignment .</text>

		<text>I appreciate the effort that went into making this course as well as obtaining the film clips . Having said that , if you want to go deeper into the psychology of memory this course is probably not for you . As I progressed through the weeks , I found myself becoming less and less interested since I already know the basics of memory and psychology . I felt I wasn ' t learning anything new but the clips of films allowed me to see the films in a new light . Maybe if I had bought the book that goes along with the course , i would have gained more insight but as a standalone course , it rates just three stars .</text>

		<text>I think this was a very good course . Level of instruction and pace were appropriate for someone with 2 hours / week to spend and who wanted to improve their knowledge of these topics . Its probably more useful for someone with some previous experience , limited time and some problems they want to solve , rather than a student . It had a good balance between a lot of breadth for time invested . If you approach this as a high - level overview that will help you efficiently focus your own search for knowledge it ' s extremely well done ; I thought knowledge communicated for the amount of time spent was quite high .</text>

		<text>The lectures were not very interesting or instructive . The reading materials were much more so . However , the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self - reflection than on the materials . I learned a little bit , and as such found the course worth the time I put into it , but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials , and thus derive very little benefit from it . I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping .  In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials , I think more real - life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition . )</text>

		<text>This is an excellent course . It ' s very thought - provoking and provides insight into meditation - - a subject that eludes many people . The course needs more quizzes to help students learn and remember the knowledge taught in the lectures . It also needs a better evaluation scheme - - the two essay - only evaluation form does not do enough to test student knowledge . Test are needed . A better evaluation scheme would weigh testing and essays , for example , 60 % testing , 40 % essay .</text>

		<text>It is just turning out to be a tremendous experience . Robert Schiller , or Bob Schole ( as carl Icaahn calls him ) is one heck of a personality ! the man holds a sea of depth knowledge and history in him . I ' m barely half way through the course but it is just unbelievably informative , and has the right balance of knowledge , explanation , my favorite thing psychology , and the guest speaker every week is the cherry on top !</text>

		<text>IMHO , Excellent introductory course . Well planned , enabling students to interact and take baby steps into this really powerful language . Smart , casual and yet precise lessons will help you to go through the initial necessary steps in the language , building a fundamental base where you will construct your python coding skills ! . Loved it . Platform quizzes and assignments help you make progress and push you to review your notes and the book content , enabling you to feel comfortable with the speed of the lessons . Thanks to Chuck and the Teaching Staff of Python for Everybody !</text>

		<text>I am so glad to have found this course ! ! I had taken a course on MOS transistor operation during grad school , and never quite felt comfortable with the material , since not much time was spent discussing how the relevant mosfet equations came about . Professor Tsividis ' s discourse is like a breath of fresh air . They are so lucid that I feel I understand the material better now . The course is well structured ; as I go through it systematically , I can see how one lesson connects to the concepts presented in a previous one . Thank you so much , Dr . Tsividis for sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge about this topic .</text>

So now that I finished it , it ' s impact on my learning is a matter of practice ) It ' s also very inspiring to see all of the personal examples ( see additional interviews ) , especially from Dr .

		<text>I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman ' s Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology . I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved ( the studies Dr . Fredrickson refers to are for the most part only touched on briefly ) , and to have spent less time listening to the on - site students discussing their personal opinions ( though I appreciated their insights , I would have liked to have learned more actual information ) . I did get something out of the experiential activities . Although they are optional , I would recommend doing them to really get something out of the class . They allowed me to stop and think about things I may not have made the time for otherwise .</text>

		<text>This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic , but doesn ' t go into much depth . While it ' s clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material , I still would not recommend this course . Both the presentation itself and the in - video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious . The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to , and the in - video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time . Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities , which are badly designed and just frustrating . Overall , I recommend waiting for a better course .</text>

		<text>Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn ' t sufficient . Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes . This is the reason why Andrew Ng ' s Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging . Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful . I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session .</text>

		<text>There is a lot of self - teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions . In addition , the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding . At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code . This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before .</text>

		<text>Amazing - way more depth than the first course , and much narrower focus . Emily teaches all courses here and dives into the math and usage . Programming hints are given but no more walkthroughs of the code . Assignments laid out such that you need to code the algorithms correctly in order to pass assignments . Emily has an excellent way of explaining the math / calculous / reasoning behind the algorithms and proofs thereof . Love it .</text>

		<text>Absolutely a great course ! It was a bit strong on the advertising in the beginning but after the first few lectures this significantly decreased . Dr Hare is one of the leading researchers in dog cognition , and he also goes into a the cognition of a number of other animals . It was a very interesting course and I highly recommend it .</text>

I took this course to prepare for a potential opportunity in my workplace and it has certainly paid off ! Auditing the course gave me access to all of the course material and knowledge I needed without having to empty my bank account . With student debt , this was a lifesaver and career builder .</text>

		<text>I DON ' T recommend this course AT ALL . This college doesn ' t spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos ( less than 10mins in total per a week ) and external references ( which someone else wrote ) . The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other . I haven ' t learn anything from this course . It ' s just a waste of time and money . Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses / specializations provided by other universities though , A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning . This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques , concepts and best practices . If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist , this is your gateway . This course will leave you equipped and confident to get into the amazing world of Machine Learning . Professor Ng and his team has truly created a gem . I wish they would create and release the Deep Learning course , which delves into further models and topics currently very hot in the world of ML .</text>

		<text>Great course ! I highly recommend it both for teachers and teacher trainers . All content is delivered in a very engaging manner . Although I have already had a solid previous experience in the area , I have gained a lot from this course . It is definitely worth taking if you are interested in effective professional development . the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms . For example , the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market . Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year . for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15 % , then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year .</text>

		<text>This is a very good introduction to machine learning . It covers a very broad set of material , and the lectures are very clear . The quizzes and programming assignments are based directly on the course material , making it easy to complete the assignments if you understand the lecture material ( in contrast with some other courses I have taken where the assignments require lots of extra material not taught in the course ) . It is very helpful to have some programming experience , and some knowledge of linear algebra , probability , and calculus . The course is very topical , so it does not go very deep into the material , but it does offer some practical advice for using machine learning algorithms in daily applications .</text>

Professor Edwin Bakker didactic approach is especially suitable to my ideal concept of how a teacher should communicate with his / her audience . Together with Moral Foundations of Politics held by Professor Ian Shapiro , I would rate these two the most attractive and expectations matching courses I ' ve ever come across online .

		<text>Great introduction to Java . Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start , rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses , which is really cool . No peer review , just quiz questions that can only be answered if the assignment is completed correctly . The assignments are therefore not particularly challenging - - you get out of this class what you put in !</text>

		<text>The course is really good with a lot of intuition and technical details . The assignments and quizzes help clarify concepts and ideas . However the course requires a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics , so it may not be a course for people without such background . In addition , since the course has been out there for a few years , not many people joined my session and only a handful of people participated in the discussion forum . The forum has been quiet and not much help can be sought from the forum .</text>

Under a name that doesn ' t tell much about the content there is a real jewel - a multidisciplinary course that is truly able to connect many of the dots and make perfect sense of all these endless math and science , history and many other classes we all had to sit throughout our school years . I loved every minute of this course , all the experts zooming into subjects , all of additional materials ( especially Crushcourse videos ) . Big History course is awesome for those always asking &quot; but why ? &quot; questions . A very big thank you to The Big History course team for finding time and passion for making it available to everyone in the world !</text>

The assignments where challenging enough in weeks 1 , 2 , and 3 . For the 4th week however , I found the assignment a little difficult due to lack of explanation caused , in my opinion , by the fact that the we only had one week to introduce JavaScript and ajax .

		<text>I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area , as well as great machine learning enthusiasts . However , I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and ( very ! ) expensive platform , mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning . Ok , the platform offered makes things easier , but if you really want to learn machine learning , you can not be limited to a platform , acting as a robot just using pre - written functions in a black box .</text>

		<text>Andrew Ng teaches a great Machine Learning course . Ng speaks clearly and the flow of the class is easy to follow . The examples made things clear and the homework exercises really cemented the learning points . Overall , the class was just the right amount of challenge and fun . I now have a solid understanding and intuition about Machine Learning and will use what I ' ve learned . Thank you Andrew Ng !</text>

		<text>This is an ok introductory course , a compilation of concepts , related to sustainable cities . Mentiones a list of places where one or another practice is implemented . Some educational clips look like they are taken from Youtube or like promo videos for a certain initiative . Some of the &quot; lecturers &quot; are just phd students , introducing their research topics . No step - by - step examples of developed cases are shown .</text>

		<text>This course is a must for students and teachers alike . As a final year neuroscience PhD candidate I expected to know by now how to learn , yet I got a wealth of advice and new insights . It is a very useful course , with two very good teachers . Not only do they give you great studying and test taking tips , which you can apply immediately ( which is why I think teachers should follow this course as well ) , they give you a lot of scientific background to these tips .</text>

		<text>Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course . Booksite , video materials and assignments are amazing . Would recommend this course to everyone ! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in KD tree . Critical information when to prune the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted . not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks . hard for a student ( even one who has a programming background ) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront . The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course . the whole course seems disjointed . would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving .</text>

		<text>Excellent course ! One of the best I have ever taken on photography . It opens up a large variety of topics and plots them along the evolution of photography from its very beginning to today . All of the content was hugely interesting , the materials and required readings were well - chosen and , most important of all , the course opened my eyes to many new possibilities of creative expression . This course is a must for anyone seriously interested in the subject of photography .</text>

		<text>After the first week , the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums . The capstone project itself was disappointing , I learned much more from doing my own app in class # 3 . I took the Coursera Android specialization , which was eons better than this . I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone . I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto .</text>

		<text>The content of the slides were sufficient for the basic intent of this offering . The overview and reasoning behind why the products are competitive for other contending services was clear . When performing the labs , the content is very recipe driven . While that works well for someone attempting to get the work done , there needs to be some visuals prepared that show how the GCP components are laid out and the relationship they have to each other ( simple architecture views ) . The GCP products have very similar sounding names , so paragraphs describing what is happening have less effect , whereas some simple architecture views of what the lab is intending to do to go with that in the lab content itself , might help .</text>

		<text>This course has been highly delightful to learn through the concepts of machine learning . For someone like me having 17years programming experience , and with some hands on of neural networks from colelge days , and analytic tools for a few applications in R ; it is a great refresher on the fundamentals and great breadth of practical technology elements that are most useful in machine learning applications . Andrew ' s teaching method is great . His clear and simplistic delivery style of complex concepts with apt examples ensures the student grasps the essence with ease and works navigates his way through complex algorithms with confidence . I would love sitting through his lectures in the future too ! Congratulations to the entire team that put together this course and making this a great service that is available for anyone wanting to learn ML !</text>

		<text>I thought this was a very interesting course on a topic I knew nothing about . Apart from the history of the Jews in China I learnt a great deal about China in the 19th and 20th century . My only criticism of the course was the very confusing rubric for peer marking the assignments . The criteria were very specific and , in my view , didn ' t necessarily reflect the subject of the essay .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class . This class was at it ' s best during the recitals , where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos .</text>

There ' s a fair amount of work required , but I appreciate that . There ' s also plenty of activity in the discussion forums . I notice that some students have complained about having to pay attention to the lectures . This course is possibly not a good choice for anyone who wants to be spoon fed .</text>

I am planning to finish everything in this 5 - course specialization , and this first course definitely gives you a good start in mastering this wonderful language . Thanks ! very fundamental . however , I do think it was a bit bold to state that on completion of the course that students would have the skills to write essays independently . Following the grading of some peer assignments , I would be concerned if that were still the case . Otherwise , I found some useful tools for writing in all the courses . Thank you .</text>

		<text>A very thought - engaging and enjoyable course . I learned a lot about the history and contexts of various Muslim countries , the challenges faced by them as well as the practical challenges that Islamic - based political thought have not demonstrably addressed so far . The instructor is very knowledgeable and well - meaning . I like the course ' s approach of not so much attempting to answer the questions as just a ' tour guide ' and an entry point to the much more complex discussion about the topic . I might not agree with everything in the course , and some of his statements might have made me a bit uncomfortable , but overall this is an engaging and insightful course .</text>

		<text>It is a wonderful course for serious learners wanting to learn about the human nervous system and how it works . I myself am a medical doctor ( I graduated over two years ago ) and I can attest that ( in my university at least ) I didn ' t have neuroscience lectures with this depth and detail . Due to my medical background I found it comfortable to go through the course without much effort or lots of extra studying . But I figure that if you do not have some such foundation it might be a bit more challenging to go smoothly with the course , and you might needs more extra studying and more time put into the course . But if you are interested about neuroscience and want to learn the essentials of how the human brain works ( as per our current knowledge ) then I recommend that you put in the effort and go with the course even if you don ' t have a strong background in the life sciences or in medicine . Many thanks to Dr White and everybody else who have participated in creating and maintaining this course .</text>

		<text>Great course ! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve . The case studies were relevant and interesting , and the guest speakers were good as well . I wish discussions had been a little more structured - it was kind of a free - for - all which led to a lot of off - topic nonsense to weed through . After the second week , I really stopped checking in because it was too time consuming and that ' s a little sad . But that would be my only suggestion for improvement .</text>

		<text>I had a lot of fun during this course , but I think it is simply too short to present all the topics in sufficient detail . Furthermore , I took this course without doing the prior courses in the specialization , and there were a couple of moments when I really thought previous knowledge from a different course was required . I think for the most part the lecturers did a great job in explaining the materials in the course . The lectures themselves were also well structured , and the topics followed each other in a logical order . I would have loved to spend more time on modeling techniques and Markov Chain Monte Carlo .</text>

It is peer graded which is extremely unreasonable , people do not read the submissions fully or fully have the knowledge to be able to grade someone else ' s work .

		<text>This course has two great projects . A simulated MIP track and a Physical lab track in which we will make a Rover . If you are ambitious you can even implement slam on the AR track . AR track is on raspberry pie and the simulation track is on matlab . This course will give you the basics for a robotics career I believe .</text>

		<text>The course was very informative and is easy to follow . The professor has a lot of case studies which shows he is a marketing practitioner and shares real / sample cases that help you better understand the concepts taught ( not just theoretically ) . He also supplemented the class with interview / talks with professionals who make use of ROI , Media Attribution and Data collection and they share their advise to students from their own experience . I truly enjoyed this course and learned so much . I have recommended it to my friends who are market research / consumer insight practitioners .</text>

		<text>For everyone involved in Public Health ( and not only ) , complexity is obvious . Dealing with complexity is not ! This highly pedagogical course offers all the necessary knowledge and tools to deal with it , while leaving behind the linear abstractive way of thinking . The lectures are analytical , highly informative , finely structured and well focused . Not boring even for a moment . I highly recommend it !</text>

		<text>Great case study , but the way to engage the audience might have been way better . Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power , because they were quite boring . Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment . Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization . Capstone should have been done by the same ( high ) standards as other courses in specialization .</text>

		<text>Great course . my constructive criticism has to do with the organizing of the group activities , it ' s just very difficult to organize into groups via people whom you have not met , especially given the time zone differences as well the differences in daily schedules for group members . I just wonder if there ' s a possibility to organize the group projects in such a way that the website allows for better asynchronous work ( not just emailing back and forth as that feels very disorganized ) ? Otherwise I feel that I learned a lot and I feel that this is a great intro class . i ' ve learned tons of new things . i would like to have more materials on the subject . could the staff attach some recommended readings ? other courses ? than you for making this course : )</text>

		<text>This is an extremely basic course . In my opinion , it isn ' t worth $ 49 and is thrown in just to add to the total price of the specialization . It is a useful refresher , but doesn ' t really contain much information . Just a couple of topics are covered at a very basic level . You could also get this info from watching Youtube videos .</text>

		<text>Good overview and introduction to the more detail content of the following courses . If you are not familiar with Python , this will ease you into the language and enable you to follow . There is a certain style of teaching that you need to get accustomed too in the beginning but when it is done , lessons become very clear and easy to follow . Moreover , it becomes &quot; so what is happening next ? &quot; and you are looking forward to the next lesson . Again , this is mainly an overview ( with content ) and a lot of the material will be reviewed more in detail afterwards .</text>

		<text>This is easily the best introductory statistical mechanics course on - line . Prof . Cramer presents the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics in a sensible manner which makes this difficult subject somewhat manegable even for beginners . People with former experience with statistical mechanics will , on the other hand , benefit from the inclusion of the more involved connections to quantum mechanics and physical chemistry .

		<text>Very professional course , thank you for that ! The only thing I was missing in this course was how to learn in non - academical conditions . How to find time if you work 8 hours per day and come home tired while you have prepare something to eat and so on . . How to motivate yourself if there is no test , if you are learning only for yourself ? How you can practice that what you are learning if you are doing something completely different in your professional life ? These are questions for that I really need an answer , the rest I know from your course , big thank you once again ! : )</text>

		<text>This class was really difficult . The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes ( particularly in Week 3 &amp; 4 ) and the final exam was immensely difficult . Additionally , the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i . e . repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs . I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn ' t have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class .</text>

		<text>I am very much enjoying how my professor breaks everything down to the simplest form . I find myself applying what I have learned to my everyday writing as well as things I read and watch . He is upbeat and energetic and the assignments are fun ! Although he asks for 200 words and I find that difficult because I am accustomed to writing a small novel for each answer , as you can clearly tell from my review of this course . I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to begin writing or to writers who want a fundamental understanding of what they are already doing .</text>

		<text>There is quality implicit in the approach taken , but in my opinion , this course is excessively short , having only 20 - 25 minutes of videos per week , what is very limiting . Also there is no slides of the material covered what I find not adequate . To fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures , slides would be determinant . Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning .</text>

		<text>The assignments are not really commensurate to the content , i . e . they are much simpler and superficial and do not really test the content , which is deeper and implies practical activities difficult to measure . The title is also partially misleading , at least for me , and I would rather call it a blues introduction to jazz improvisation . But the content and the exercises proposed are great , one of the best and no nonsense approach to bebop improvisation I ' ve ever found</text>

		<text>This course on software security was very informative . This is the best place to start off for a beginner as it not only covers the technical aspects of security , but also talks about modelling threats and identifying adversaries and their capabilities . I however was slightly disappointed with the testing methods of this course . I feel that most of the testing should have been on the basis of projects and a project should have been included every week . But , all in all taking the course was a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly enjoyed all the projects that were given . Looking forward to taking the next course in the specialization ! !</text>

		<text>Very interesting , up - to - date and relevant concepts on marketing and communication tools and how they relate to the fundamental goal of achieving long - term brand loyalty . I like the practical examples used as they help to illustrate the concepts well . If a little more coverage could be provided on digital marketing , it would be great . Nonetheless , this is a great course for introducing the fundamentals of traditional marketing and communication tools . Great description on the theoretical concepts related to advertising strategies especially - some psychology involved , in the context of consumer behaviour , and I appreciate these associations especially since Psychology is my undergraduate major .</text>

		<text>This course is an excellent survey of introductory sales techniques and thinking . In addition , it allows you to access Craig Wortmann ' s &quot; Sales Toolkit &quot; , which I think is highly valuable and able to be carried over into other personal / professional situations . However , the rigor of feedback from classmates was sometimes lacking , and the problem sets / videos took hardly any time . More time could be spent on them , but without more intense feedback from seasoned sales professionals , it might not be worth the investment . Overall , I am satisfied with having paid for this course in order to get that feedback and the certificate .</text>

		<text>The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions . The topics are covered by providing plenty of background explanation , though I found the repetition way too much at times . I would have liked to see the English in the slides , transcription of the videos , and most importantly , in the quizzes , proofread - at times , the seemingly small errors made it hard to understand what the quiz questions were about . A good introductory course all around . Thanks for your efforts !</text>

The teacher is absolute wonderful because I knows how to explain the complex concepts and theory in an easy way . Definitely , he is a great teacher . It has been hard , and took me more time than expected , but I am really happy for having completed it . Now I will try to do another one about data science .</text>

		<text>I found the course to be taught exceptionally well . Andrew is clearly passionate about ML as well as educating the masses about it . The use of real - life examples is a fantastic learning aid , in the videos and in the programming exercises . I enjoyed learning Octave and performing the weekly homework ; the exercises showed me how to perform tasks simply that would seem impossible to a lay person . My eyes have been opened and will look to future - proof my career by continuing my studies in ML .</text>

		<text>Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work . I get the feeling this is quite a new course ( compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization ) and does not have the student interaction base yet . I hope this aspect develops - perhaps even with the TAs . For this level course student interaction could be even more valuable than the more hands on data science subjects . Hope this specialization takes off as well as the DSS did !</text>

		<text>I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities , but this course is clearly biased . The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest . A university is meant to teach the whole story , and have a truthful account of facts . I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals , on the pretext of unbiased learning . This course clearly has an agenda . I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not .</text>

		<text>The course is definitely high - quality and the topics are covered in a good way . I ' m not giving 5 stars because I would have expected SVMs and neural networks . Mentioning the many different algorithms for learning decision trees would have been nice , without necessarily focusing on each of them in depth . An entire week spent on precision / recall seems a little bit too much , without touching other metrics like F - score . Overall though a very nice course for beginners , and it definitely gives a good sense of classification challenges and approaches .</text>

		<text>It is a great course for me . At the end of the course , I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation . As opposed to the stated prerequisite , I believe the course requires engineering / math / physics background . On the down side , there is no TA presence in the discussion forum . You will need to rely on your classmates if you are stuck . Also the second assignment requires hours of tuning , which serves almost no educational purpose .</text>

		<text>There is some good content on creativity in this course , thoug it barely addresses problem solving .  Do something different &quot; assingments were an interesting idea . Some content material is missing , including the link to a text that is needed to answer a quizz which will influence your final grade . Grading standards are weird : maximum grades are to be given to assignments performed in public , as if things done in private aren ' t creative ; there are better ways to have someone get out of their comfort zone . Assingments request that you be photographed or filmed , and there is no disclaimer that your photos or your privacy will be protected . If you are an introvert or simply a person who values privacy , this is not the course for you .</text>

		<text>The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .</text>

		<text>If you have some background programming in another language , and some familiarity with HTML / CSS , this course does a fantastic job introducing both Ruby and Rails . The first week walks you through machine and environment setup , the second walks through the basics of the Ruby programming language , and the third walks through using the Rails framework to develop simple websites in Ruby . All the lessons are laid out clearly with solid examples . That said , this is not a beginner course . It really only spends a week covering how to program in Ruby , and Ruby has some quirks that make it a challenging first language . If you ' re brand new to programming , do yourself a favor and take an introductory course first .</text>

		<text>Very nice course with solid foundation and great examples . One recommendation would be to split the material on Week 4 into 2 weeks : Week 4 and Week 5 . The teachers would have more time for explaining every bit in the lectures so the difficulty would step up evenly between weeks . Other than the amount of material on last week , it is a good course and highly recommended ! its fun and well taught but i was having a little trouble understanding how to go about some of the topics here this course being my first ever programming class i have ever taken . all in all i enjoyed every bit of it and its something i see myself doing in the future . Two thumbs up ! !</text>

That ' s the only reason I do not give a straigth 5star reward , since I believe that the lack of real life interaction is not fully recovered by the quizzes and excercises , they should be more in my opinion . Of course , I understand that this course might also be intented for even a complete amateur and I respect the fact to let this quiz and test part simplified . I will definitely follow the next courses of the Python circle .</text>

		<text>The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python , I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically . Where it falls down though is the assignment auto - grader . It ' s immensely fussy ( as I understand it has to be ) , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don ' t sufficiently explicitly define whats expected . This means you spend more than 50 % of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so . I would recommend this course , but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future .</text>

		<text>While there are a few technical issues , this is an awesome course . Not only is it is very detailed and informative , but entertaining and sometimes even amusing . Being so detailed and informative , a lot of the material is quite challenging . The tests in particular are tough . However , I highly recommend this course because it will make you really appreciate astronomy as a field and the solar system .</text>

		<text>If you happen to have the required background but somehow never got beyond beginner - level GR , this is a thoroughly enjoyable course ! There are obviously many text - books and online videos to learn more - or - less the same concepts , but the assignments here are the high point , they are hard , but for me personally , they are what made this course special . Completing this course somehow makes me feel much better prepared to self - study the intermediate / advanced level GR books I ' ve owned for so long ! Many thanks to Prof .

I still can ' t understand why its not allowed the access to the projects to students that won ' t purchase the course . There are several of other courses @ Coursera that require payment only if you want the certificate . I guess that hundreds of students would be happy to see that as the general procedure .

		<text>This will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason . The entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses . As a result this is a pretty bland and boring 4 weeks . The assignments feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded . The saving grace is that the course is just 4 weeks and can be completed in a fairly short amount of time .</text>

		<text>Was a little too basic . Would have preferred more flesh ( both implementational and mathematical ) on the bones . I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly &quot; this is for the experts in linear algebra &quot; . Come on ! If one is taking a machine learning course , one can expect more from the students . Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap - dance on the surface of the material .</text>

The UCI program is one of the best introductions to Objective - C and iOS programming that I ' ve come across . The curriculum is well thought out and follows a logical progression . Don does an excellent job presenting the concepts in a way that is easy to follow , but not overly simplified . Grading is done as peer reviews , which is nice as it allows you to see how your fellow peers approached the problem . I really enjoyed this course and am looking forward to the next one .</text>

		<text>This course was simple . Since it is intended as an overview of few machine learning techniques used to build computer based rational agents it has completely fulfilled my curiosity about what intelligent applications can be built using machine learning algorithms . Professors Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin did an excellent job of presenting the course in an engaging way and with enough hands - on exercises to better understand the lessons . I am excited to take the next specialization courses to better understand the inner workings of each algorithm , and perhaps manage to understand why these algorithms work the way they do , specially the Deep Learning algorithms . Thank you Coursera for the opportunity and thank the Professors Emily and Carlos for such a valuable gift of sharing knowledge for free .</text>

		<text>Machine Learning is a complete course about the mathematical techniques to make computers learn by themselves . In this course you will study the rationale behind mathematical algorithms and learn how to translate it into computation languages such as Octave or MAtlab . Warning : the course is fast - paced and requires some intermediate level on calculus , programming and algebra . You will be able to pass the course even if you are not pro at that but it will be hard !</text>

		<text>Neither statistics nor R was covered in any meaningful way . At the end of the course , you are left with frustration for having to jump through the loops , but no understanding of the principles . I am a college instructor for Statistics , having graduated from a PhD program - even with that background I could not follow the instructor . The course designer never considered the audience , and never identified the goals of this course . The instructor was lost between teaching R and teaching stats , so in the end he did neither . Worst course I have ever taken , both online and face - to - face .</text>

This idea has never struck me before , but interacting with texts provides &quot; room &quot; on the page for my conversation with the writer , which is a visual reminder that all texts are part of an ongoing discussion and are not the last word on a given subject . Thank you , Prof . Bazanova !</text>

		<text>This course has been very interesting , however I believe that the mix of genre has been somewhat limited . While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists , I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance : picking up litter , photographing it , and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography , unless the artist ' s message is in documenting our ' throw - away ' society and highlighting the importance of ' recycling ' for the benefit of the environment . Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion . The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused . The interviewer ( s ) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist ( s ) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests . My argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent .</text>

		<text>DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE - THE guy who reads ( not teaches ) the course , Justin - Nicholas Toytama is horrendous . He ' s too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world ' s most monotonous voice . He pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class . If this class is not part of the certificate specialization , i wouldn ' t even pay for this course . 64 gets you further with Nick Walter or Rob Percival ' s Udemy course .</text>

		<text>Very good basic course for everyone interested in the European Union . Here you can learn about the past and the present state of affairs in the EU , as well as get to know some future challenges . The course is filled with lots of EU - related facts and statistics and presents the EU from different points of view . I would say the course is quite a &quot; light &quot; one : there are no peer - reviewed assignments and quizzes are rather short and easy , but it definitely gives food for thought . Be aware that the videos are in French but with English subtitles .</text>

		<text>People use Python for many purposes : to make games , build web services , to solve business problems , to work with sensors , drivers and robots . Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work . Python is an incredibly efficient language : your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require . Py4inf and Python explained by C . Servance , is a great developing of the foundations in programming ( first two courses ) that will serve you well for the rest of your life , as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you . I strongly recommend this course for anybody , who wants to start with informatics .</text>

		<text>I can only infer that this course ' s target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities . Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples , watching the videos at 2x speed . The course itself is incredibly shallow , even for a survey course , and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors ' own products - - Graphlab Create . You ' ll be much better off taking Andrew Ng ' s course , which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library . The only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matlab .</text>

		<text>Excellent course ! I find this Fundamentals of Graphic Design very useful for everyone not just designer . It does not only provide me with very basic yet very useful knowledge of graphic design but also helped me greatly in practicing certain skills that I never thought I would have . The assignments and all peer - review sessions are quite challenging too though the video sessions with the teachers always sound very easy to understand . I love this challenge anyway . Strongly recommended .</text>

		<text>This is an excellent course for two reasons : first the video lectures are very good , introducing complex concepts in a relatively accessible manner , and second the automated submission system is good at marking your ( well designed ) assignments . What could be better : compared to a traditional ( physical ) course , I miss the notes . It would be very useful if there was some form of notes , either as an informal textbook or cheat - sheets for each lecture . Another improvement would be that in some cases , it ' s possible to ' solve ' the assignments without necessarily understanding them . This is because you are sometimes given ' too many ' hints or the transformation of the existing code to the final form is rather trivial . Overall an excellent course though .</text>

Otherwise , pretty good .</text>

		<text>I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well . I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook . However , after taking this course , I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general . My only criticism is that the course still uses an older version of Python which has some differences and can make the learning frustrating if you are not aware of those differences . Granted , with a free textbook for an older version this is a minor issue thus far in the series .</text>

		<text>I am sorry to say this , but the tutorial could have been organzied in a much more serious way . I do not know how much time the Professors have put on preparation . But it gives me a &quot; sloppy &quot; impression ! ! ! The class carries the name of University of Duke and 70 euros are charged , so I think the learners would reasonably expect to see that the teacher puts lots of time to organize the course structure , in order to efficiently give as much as information to the learners within limited time ! For example , I believe nobody would not say that the Week 2 content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained . And this is just one example .</text>

		<text>My condition : a total computer science newbie . This course , as its proclamation , is very suitable for someone like me . It is a condense and delicate course , which means in order to get the skill to build a website , the only thing has to be done is following the steps in the video and finishing the assignment ; and yet every topic in the course , even a line of code , deserves further contemplation .  Why Yakkov does this instead of that ? &quot; is a question I frequently ask myself during the course . In short , this course provide a solid ground for developing skills in web development , and I sincerely recommend it to everyone who ' s interested in this field .</text>

		<text>Functional Program Design in Scala is one of the best courses for those who want to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications using functional programming concepts . This course is intended to be taken after Functional Programming Principles in Scala . It is a great course for those who want to explore into the functional programming aspect of Computer Science . The concepts are explained lucidly and the assignments are relatively difficult and help the individuals to apply the learnt concepts in an incremental manner .

		<text>I like this course a lot because it solidified my understanding of regression . I have often read about regression when reading scientific articles however , i never took the time to really investigate the mechanics on how it is done . Thanks to this course i can now appreciate better the journals that i read . Furthermore , the course project for this course was quite interesting , not too hard , and was bit challenging . There was plenty of time to finish the project and some extra time to make it even better than a simple submission that meets the basic requirements of the course . Thanks to the my classmates and the nice people in Coursera and R , i had a great time learning during this course .</text>

The professor is really entertaining and is great at teaching . I definitely recommend this to someone trying to get an introduction to programming .</text>

		<text>Lectures and quizzes are okay , assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics . I have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs . However , I do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasks . Programming assignments aren ' t really friendly to Haskell ' s list , and vectors are not available . If you use Haskell , you ' ll be forced to work with arrays or sequences , which are not as nice .</text>

		<text>This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package , but suffers from some problems . The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments . The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky . As a result , every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants , instead of actually learning pandas . I managed to pass this course with ( what I know is ) subpar code , but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments . The course has potential , but as it is now , I will continue this specialisation .</text>

Instead of dreading class I found myself excited about attending everyday and was able to progress faster than the course outline due to his extremely clear and supportive teaching method . I ' m already reading data from files and it isn ' t even covered until the next course . If you take this class , read the book and you will do well .</text>

		<text>Tons of value - - for free ! ! I hope in future iterations of this course you could include more tangible tools we can use to help grow our business . These lectures included a few resources - - but more could definitely be introduced . As a business owner myself , this course has shed some light on things I hadn ' t considered - - and offered a more academic approach to business . I hope in the future more &quot; resources &quot; could be included - - because I think many people considering starting their own business but don ' t realize how many excellent resources are available ( and many times for free - - just take Coursera , for example ! ! )</text>

Thanks so much for making this course - I gained a lot from it , especially from giving and receiving feedback from fellow students . The only thing I didn ' t enjoy much are some questions in the tests because sometimes they seem a bit irrelevant . I would recommend making the tests a bit more to the point and reducing the amount of questions ( especially the one in the final tests like &quot; who inspired the angel and devil debate &quot; : ) Thanks for your work ! ! !</text>

		<text>Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion . The discussion forum does not work as intended . There is too much noise . They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated . It all seems rushed and not rewarding . I do not think that my outcome of this course has been significant because of the structure of the course and I regret that I have paid for all 3 courses .</text>

I decided to take the course also , and my 6 - year - old son , who is highly motivated , participated with me . I got some key benefits from the course , particularly the pomodoro technique , which I am using . The side benefit to doing this &quot; as a family &quot; is that it gives us a vocabulary and common experience around which to discuss learning concepts together .</text>

I also appreciated the passion is the delivery of the course by the lecturer , her enthusiasm made watching all the videos worthwhile . Thank you for this introduction - it made a significant difference in my life the knowledge touch here is really good . however , the speed is a little bit quick . I paused and go back and forth usually . the last introduction of assignment 4 is not clear . I took quite a long time to figure what to use to calculate the price ratio and what to use to run ttest .</text>

Personally , I feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics ( simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course ) . The logical progression of how to approach different problems - and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the window . If you ' re new to statistics , I suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided . . .</text>

		<text>Extremely well done videos , Professor Sachs is articulate and clear . The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment . The quiz are not easy , one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5 . However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it ' s a good learning process . It never fails to amaze me how much data we have collected globally and for so long !</text>

		<text>The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking . You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand . Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project , in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project . The quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning . Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences .</text>

		<text>Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science . Fast paced course with good supplementary materials . The homework is progressively challenging . Sophie the Teaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forums . I don ' t recommend this course for those without programming or python scripting experience . Also , the homework exercises took me significantly longer than the estimates projected , but I budgeted about double the time and was able to complete the course on time .</text>

		<text>The course was very useful with what knowledge it provides . However , it would be better if there were more hands - on exercises on relevant stuff . The exercises are too easy and boring . Tougher exercises should be added and more time should be spent on the Hadoop Ecosystem part . Knowing the history helps but it should not replace more important topics . great Info ! great techaer ! great excercises ! , great simulations ! do not hesitate in taking this one ! very happy with the result</text>

		<text>As for information in course itself , it was interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the course . But I highly dislike that there was a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any things right while the video goes . It is not a real class , it is a video and it could be done much more accurately . There were many many boring moments , while management itself is not a boring discipline , it is very interesting . Anyway I am glad I participated in the course .</text>

		<text>I found the assignments to be sometimes confusing ( i read the description of a question , thought i was supposed to answer several steps at once , only to realise that the tasks would be broken down in muc more detail later ) . Once i figured out the style , it was much easier , and i would be sure to read entire assignment first . Additionally , i sometimes didnt know whether errata notes were relevant to the code i was actually using , or previous offerings of the same course . Overall though , very good ! Thanks !</text>

		<text>These courses on Ancient Life Evolution are best when they discuss how species developed , how they adapted and how they were discovered . The laundry listing of species in some of the lectures was a snooze fest however . It also repeated what was in other lectures for the week . I would have preferred more information on the ecosystem in which the critters dwelled . The Ancient Marine Reptile class did a much better job of presenting this info although it did some laundry listing .</text>

		<text>Very good hands - on approach to practical machine learning . However , as the models get more complicated , some of the material isn ' t really explained very well , specially the last module about ' deep learning ' is quite superfluous . I also wish , the course favored providing a bit more mathematical intuition over just graphlab usage . All things aside , if you are really curious about machine learning you should take this course . Be hungry !</text>

		<text>Only one assignment at the end , so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code ( this seems like a big mistake for any programming course ) . The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes . You can ' t put that as a project on a resume , because you ' re doing 5 % of the work with your hand held through it . Worst of all , the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices , like local variables not being declared ( so that they become global variables , a big no - no ) , spacing being all over the place , etc . JavaScript has a bad reputation , and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad .</text>

		<text>The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R . This being said , I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth ( with further practice ) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery . I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy , and only now ( after completing the course here on Coursera , reading the textbook ( s ) , and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp ) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R . This being said , the course was very well organized , had great examples , and excellent lectures ( although the audio could be clarified by quite a bit using a higher - end microphone , preamp , interface , and affordable audio production software such as Reaper to clarify the voice ) .</text>

This is the only course I ' ve found on the many MOOC sites out there that goes into this much depth . One downside is that Coursera lacks support in general , but I do not consider it downside of this course but Coursera ' s . In terms of frameworks , many people like me have completed the course using Numpy and Scikit - learn instead of Dato , so it is doable !</text>

		<text>This was so far the best free online course I have done . Great videos in which Dr . Vázquez - Cognet well explained the Microeconomics Principles , in a lively interactive way while using good examples from a daily life . The weekly multiple choice quiz which could be repeated ( varying the questions ) until the subject is fully undertood and minimum score met also contributed to a good understanding of the subject . Unfortunately I got too little time left to participate in the discussion forums . This course motivated me to study further Economics related courses and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the subject and who is new to Microeconomics like me .</text>

		<text>An extremely well - structured and useful course . As someone who had only syntactical familiarity with Python , this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language . Moreover , the technical knowledge included ( APIs , RegEx , etc ) is highly relevant and practical . Given that it ' s part of an introductory series , the difficulty level of the assignments is understandable . But providing some more rigorous optional assignments can be a welcome addition to the course . That being said , I would recommend it to anyone looking to explore Python and the power it grants with its simplicity .</text>

		<text>Put simply , this course is well put together . Professor Andrew Metrick is an engaging lecturer and the materials assigned are very helpful in understanding the topic . If i have any recommendations i would suggest for a break down of abbreviations and concepts as i especially struggled given my non - financial background . Also , i still haven ' t figured out the discussion forum as in my opinion isn ' t as engaging . In all , thank you for a brilliant work . still redo and redo this course . : )</text>

		<text>I ' ve never valued tests , nor flash cards , nor anything that I perceived as gimmicky learning tools . Learning was just learning . But I was wrong . Understanding your cognitive behavior and how memories and knowledge are formed has helped me grasp learning in a new intuitive way . I highly recommend the course !</text>

		<text>This course is basic yet so powerful and will excite those who enroll that they would like to study the subject and that I feel is the most important objective of any course . I had already completed two game theory courses offered by Stanford university and still I found this course to be enriching . The course deals with basic conceptual knowledge of Game Theory and how and why it is useful and applicable in the world around us . I have read Professor Kandori ' s and he is one of the leading researchers in this field . I feel great to have been taught by such a faculty .</text>

		<text>Great course first of all . One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures . The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift , which are really useful , but they are not comprehensive enough . So for most of the students , I believe , will have to do a lot of self - studying to finish the final project . But still , the final project is challenging and interesting . Swift is not a hard language to learn , so after went through all the lectures and read some books on Swift programming , I was able to finish the project .</text>

		<text>This continues Dr . Chuck ' s easing into Python . It ' s a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource . The existence of the book is noted in the videos but it isn ' t really stressed , which is unfortunate as it ' s helpful . About the only thing I ' d appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity .</text>

		<text>Decent coverage of the basics , but some of the data , tools and approaches used are out of date by 2 - 3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast - moving social space . For example , they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM . For someone completely new to the social space , this could be a great starter class . Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you ' re current . After grading assignments by other students , it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat : most either didn ' t invest in the assignments or didn ' t understand the materials . While I have found the discussion portions of other MOOCs to be equally interesting to the class material , I didn ' t have that experience in this session .</text>

		<text>Excellent course ! In the first weeks , when the course started out with linear regression , I was very skeptical whether I would learn anything non - trivial here . But then I was very impressed how professor Ng managed to introduce Neural Networks until week 5 in a very clear manner . A great teacher gives you the feeling that what you are learning is easy although it is not . Great job ! The only point of criticism I have is that the programming assignements are not quite hard enough to solve , but it is still a 5 - star course for sure !</text>

		<text>I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift . The lessons felt very unstructured , unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn ' t know they were being recorded , this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an &quot; introduction to . . . course . A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming . To summarise , the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content .</text>

		<text>While this is a great course for introductory programming , I believe that it suffers from its focus on cokeskultpor UI design . The main issue I have with it is that these skills are not easily transferred to real world applications . I think some time spent on a basic introduction to tkinter would be good to help get people started on how to make their own programs . I found that the grading rubrick in particular focused too much on simple UI elements and not enough on making sure that the code was good or that the game even worked . For example , I had one person who had everything in pong perfect except that the score was added when the ball hit the paddle . This meant that the game as whole did not work as expected , but it only cost him 2 marks .</text>

		<text>The class is a pretty nice overview of metrics in general . it is more broad than it is deep , and sometimes the videos and explanations were not the most easily digested . While the content was helpful , this class could have been greatly improved if slides were provided instead of just a transcript . Finally , some of the explanations and definitions , though interesting , weren ' t often well tied together . The final assignment case study was definitely useful in thinking about several of the metrics covered over the four weeks .</text>

		<text>I would not recommend this one to any paying customer . This is the second intro to Graphic Design class I have take on Coursera , and I found the way the material was presented in the CalArts course to be quite slow and pretty boring . Our assignments were simple and I felt no excitement in doing them . It would have been beneficial to see how these fundamental building blocks could be used in real life design . The other class ( by CU - Boulder ) made me want to continue learning , and I felt excited to complete the projects whereas with this class I was forcing myself to sit down to finish just the required ones .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class . This class was at it ' s best during the recitals , where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos .</text>

I also learned about the workings of a city , how they can become more sustainable , and most of all , I now have a deep and passionate yearning to do action in my community , and to travel to progressive places such as Malmo or Copenhagen and see for myself and wonderful progressive European countries have created , and also other examples in Asia and Australia and across the globe . It was a exhilarating and exciting journey .</text>

		<text>The course material and the instructor ' s lectures are excellent . However the quizzes are programmed incorrectly - - marking wrong answers right and right answers wrong too often . I gained a few skills that I now put to use when writing songs . The course also provided some insightful information on prosody , phrasing , and a little bit of history . It was definitely worth the time I invested in doing this course .</text>

		<text>In this short course , you can learn few important key topics of business strategy . During the session there are several real cases discussed for understanding better the lesson , but several doubts remains theory . The end - of - session case studies are too complex for using the theories learned . Too many questions were not solved . but it is &quot; Foundation of . . . &quot;</text>

The lecturers attempt to make it interesting ( though sometimes they think they ' re funnier than they are ) . Regardless , it covers quite a few topics in a way that ' s very easy to understand . Some of the quizzes do seem to require an advanced calculator , but I was able to use a simple one and kind of estimate .</text>

		<text>It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer . Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough . Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit . Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit ' s intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course . Additionally , given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C , a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course .</text>

The video ' s are humorous , engaging and with so many guest speakers you are exposed to many varied viewpoints , which sets you off researching .

The course highlights the basic premises of how best to enter a market and how to keep a competitor out of the market . You will also find ways to strategically price products for profitability based on the expected , logical reaction from your competitors . Thank you Professor Kretschmer for a great course .</text>

		<text>Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics , it is definitely just an introductive class . In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material . The following are my notes and suggestions : - - I found the lectures highly redundant , with many unnecessary repetitions - - using a vector notation ( like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters ) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable - - too much hand writing on the slides while talking : a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable - - very very poor video editing ( many times it ' s clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut ! ! ) - the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology , which would be more correct and easier to understand . Just realize that ML is basically applied math , and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject</text>

		<text>This is a great introductory course . The course materials are carefully organized , to avoid lengthy mathematical content , yet conveying the key idea of machine learning . The selection of the topic also seems quite reasonable . This course builds a somewhat solid ground for beginners . After finishing this course , one can either try to move towards the more theoretical side , maybe by reading the books such as Learning From Data by Yaser Abu - Mostafa , or the lecture notes / video of the Standford course CS229 , or the more applied and practical side , depending on the preference .</text>

It deserves to become one of the coursera classics . Great combination of pedagogical talent , humor an knowledge of the subject .

		<text>I really do not like the R language I think it is sloppy and inconsistent . This class did ok teaching the basics of R , but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code ( a key part of writing code ! ) best practices for modularization and factoring , and so on . In other words , it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works , but does not teach you how to write good code in R .</text>

		<text>The course was quite difficult for me . The questions in quizes are sometimes hard to answer . Very often there is no simple solution . Or maybe my command of English was not sufficient to complete the course without several mistakes . Otherwise , topics were covered deeply and were thought - provoking .</text>

		<text>The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching . The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants . You ' re interested in this course either to ( a ) learn something about an exciting and ever changing field and / or ( b ) to have the Stanford logo on your LinkedIn profile . In both cases , move on . The curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap .</text>

		<text>I am a Saudi engineer who found this course pretty amazing course , never ever gone through similar course , indeed , I will revisit and pay for it ; reliable and sound basics of IE and Systems , looking for advanced course for the same or better coach to include them on my 2017 / 2018 developmental plan in coursera . I will send you my comments although I am not among top scored due to lack of time and lacking the good time management skills . However I am confident that I t will be of helpful as I am 12 years of experience in gas , oil and energy projects management and quality in leading energy companies in Saudi Arabia in addition to hold master degree of engineering management in 2014 .

		<text>The lecture / interview approach brings diversity and different views on the table . The topic of the MOOC is actually quite simple , and it ' s its simplicity that makes it so important - first thought for the large majority of entrepreneurs should be to raise money by their own means , ie building a sellable product and finance the business through customers . The fact that it isn ' t so nowadays , is the reason for so many failures and it ' s also why this course is so relevant .</text>

		<text>I am very grateful to faculties for this course , Dr Prasantha Kalitha and his colleagues for such a informative and ultimate course on ' Global PH Losses ' . This course is very important to all learners from developing and developed countries , since world ' s growing population facing acute food shortage , thereby saving losses becomes need of the hour . In fact this is my first time for such online course , but enjoyed the course due to support of all the colleagues in the course . Saving the food is producing the food &quot; and this course will help to accomplish this global goal . Thanks and regards , I liked the course . It really is a true beginners ' class . I think the instructor taught well with good examples illustrating each point . I deducted a point because the exercises were too easy and there weren ' t enough of them . I understand that it ' s not easy to come up with a good grading system , but the grading system definitely could be better .</text>

It has also explained and commented on many key processes that are involved in attenuation processes , about which the knowledge for those who are participating in the management of a contaminated site is mandatory . Other than that , Drs . Alvarez , Newell and Adamson showed a very good grasp over the topics discussed , with even a few funny and entertaining conversations along the lectures .

		<text>Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated . For example , it doesn ' t cover the update version of github website and how to use it . That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing . Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment . It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for .</text>

		<text>I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class , but I don ' t feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime . The class was challenging , but mostly for the wrong reasons . I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning . It also took me much longer than the 4 - 8 hours per week advertised to complete each week .</text>

		<text>This is a very comprehensive course ( based on my personal experience with Coursera at least ) that goes into relevant detail on the topics it covers , but without wasting time on unnecessary trivialities . The delivery is clear and engaging , so if you ' re interested in the matter , you won ' t get bored . The material covers all the right topics for an up and coming web designer , providing the right amount of information for a confident start and plenty of pointers where and how to expand on the knowledge provided . Another point in favor is the frequent and valuable engagement of the professor and his teaching assistants in the discussion forums , unlike some other courses that feel abandoned by the staff once they start . In closing , I ' ve checked out several web design courses on Coursera and if you can choose only one , this one would definitely be my pick from all the ones I enrolled in .</text>

		<text>This course covers a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace . It ' s not going to teach every aspect of the subjects covered - it couldn ' t possibly do so in the time - - but it teaches enough to allow students to ask the right questions later . I would like to see more searching practical exercises to cement the learning . The existing assignments follow quite closely the worked examples which means those coding along with Dr chuck aren ' t going to have too much more to do .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed this course very much . This has helped me understanding many basic things about food and what is important for my kids . There are many little helpful tips . As a working mother with 2 little kids , it ' s so much better to have seen these videos of &quot; simple cooking &quot; , than watching cook shows in TV that make cooking so complicated ( by learning nothing ) and tiring . Thanks for this great course and your effort in improving the health of kids of the world ! Best regards , Huiyan Roy , a Chinese German mother</text>

		<text>For a beginner , this course was a challenge in comparison to the other three base parts of Craft of Writing , but as a result of the challenge , it is by far the most rewarding as well . The concepts discussed , and the material provides the learners with both broad perspective into several topics that I would argue to be crucial in becoming a writer , and also a deep look at some very key concepts to writing . I would recommend taking this course last of the four , before beginning the Capstone project - if you ' re planning on going through all the parts . If you ' re a more seasoned writer , I would recommend starting with this course , and seeing how you fare with it . I ' ve enjoyed all of the base courses , but for me personally , this one struck the strongest chord .</text>

		<text>Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course . Being a true beginner w / no background in programming or data science , I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises ( which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate ) and lectures . I spent 8 - 12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in . I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems .</text>

The tutors , Vincent and Jenny , are extremely prepared and knowledgeable . They make the information easily accessible and relevant for those who work with students with difficulties . The course staff is quick to respond to any queries . I highly recommend the course for anyone interested in specialist work or supporting students .</text>

		<text>Great course , it is refreshing to revisit topic in psychology with a different perspective . I like that Professor Seamon demonstrates various phenomena associated with Hollywood films . It helps to look at the films and the psychological phenomena from a different angel and definitely enhanced my learning . If I am not wrong , he is teaching us psychology applying our episodic memory so that we retain the learning for long . Thank you .</text>

		<text>I really liked this course . I have owned and trained dogs from a very early time in my life . I found it very interesting how dogs evolved from wolves and how that is apparent in dogs today . I typically like courses to be heavy on the science side , but this class was well presented for mid - level people or people who don ' t have a science background . Of course people will disagree with some of the material but overall it was an interesting class and the book recommended for the class was a good read . Mahalo from Hawaii</text>

		<text>You can ' t introduce yourself to someone if you don ' t know who you are . This course does such a wonderful job of helping you accumulate the best of you , so that you can then present it to the rest of the world ( more specifically in this case , your interviewers . ) There are some lessons on English pronunciation , which I found a touch tedious since I ' m a native speaker , but it ' s nothing that takes away from the overall class . Professor Duquette ' s can be felt through the videos . He is clear , relevant and charming as a speaker - you honestly enjoy watching and listening to the audio content . Highly recommended !</text>

		<text>I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation . Also , the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete . This is good because if what the activity desn ' t really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you ' ve learned . However , as I ' ve said , if what you ' re being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn ' t all that practical . I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you ' ve learned and whether you ' ve retained the information or not .</text>

		<text>I never had a programming class that covers really the base of the basics in such a deep and easy to understand way , not taking for granted many things . Professor Charles Severance has a great sense of humour ( it looks like you are talking to him in person it ' s not something spectacular for the camera ) and very generous showing his team , amplifying knowledge through interviewing many interesting people . Exercises were very helpful to understand the chapters . Would appreciate if could have more exercises ( not for grade , but for practicing ) . Super recommend it !</text>

		<text>The content of the course is extremely useful for young emerging scientists like myself ; however , the videos were very hard to follow because the team speaks fast and with a very strong French accent . The materials are well - prepared , but my attention kept drifting away from the content due to language impairment . Also , some of the introductory notes were lacking proper grammar and I believe that , in a course with such a theme , this is simply unacceptable . With a bit of work , I think this can be a very useful tool in writing scientific papers !</text>

		<text>I worked really hard on this course , but was stymied by a couple of quizzes . If I could not answer one question correctly , it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions , meaning that I could not pass quiz . With no recourse , I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing . I would still like to pass , as I feel that I really earned the certificate . I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions . My other problem was using one of the models , which I never could master , despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times .</text>

Also , the platform is not structured for a course consisting of a number of courses in series , leaving the dates etc wrong . Chapter 1 and 2 should ideally show up as completed , as theey are repeated in every module ( which is fine , but the platform should take care of those members who have done these in a previous module ?</text>

A couple of the weeks , the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry . Also , I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation . I feel as though I didn ' t really understand those concepts until watching that week ' s as well as the next week ' s lectures . Finally , the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn ' t match well to what the instructors actually said .</text>

		<text>From the basic layout of the course you would assume it ' s for beginners since it covers step - by - step instructions to install software and run command on command line window . But on the other hand , many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction . I remember in one class , &quot; data dredging &quot; is discussed for about 2 - 3 minutes . But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is , instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind , you would run the risk of data dredging . I think the course could be organized in a better way . But I do appreciate the instructors ' hard work of putting up such a 10 - course specialization .</text>

		<text>Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their &quot; marvellous &quot; strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking . Rating on a 1 - 5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems , as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews . I hope it can be improved in the future !</text>

		<text>A great course to wake yourself up and get running in the world of script writing . I recommend this course to every individual who is ready to work and earn rather than just buying a online certificate . Finally David sir small but powerful video sessions are excellent . Do not go by the length of the videos . They are absolutely to the point .</text>

		<text>I am not connecting to the instructor at all . The material is well managed and organized but I am not able to really hear or understand . Further , my connection to the site is disturbing . In this and a couple of other courses , the video lectures jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture . Between these two issues , I am not having a good experience with this course . I live in the US and have graduate degrees in public health .</text>

		<text>This course seemed to me the most un - interesting course . The content though important was not taught in a way to engage the student . The professor basically read everything . I could have easily done with slides than a lecture . Hopefully , this course can be revised to make it more exciting , interesting and engaging .</text>

		<text>There are no notes for the course and the structure is quite loose . There are no assignments besides a final app . The time frame is difficult to keep up with , if you ' re not a full - time student . You ' ll spend time looking stuff up and re - running videos . If you ' ve never had a course using Xcode , this will be a steep - learning curve . it May be called Foundations to Business But it is way rich in content and i do appreciate . looking forward to the next programme . i will sure enroll .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed the contents and homeworks . Overall the delivery was very good , and I have grasped a lot . The main reason that I won ' t give 5 stars is the program assignment . I have spent and wasted 3 weeks to work on the tools , yes , tools , not the subject matter . Course should clearly indicate that the assignment only works in Linux / UNIX environment , and need to further test the scripts in most popular Linux OS platforms , different c + + versions , and different python versions .</text>

		<text>The lectures are a very brief overview of topics , with nothing actually taught . The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages . This course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to UPenn , Coursera , and everyone involved . It ' s clear that the instructors don ' t care about student ' s actually learning anything . Compare this to the &quot; Underactuated Robotics &quot; course on EdX .</text>

		<text>Excellent and well - structured course that provides learners with the key and simply - explained information about the EU , its history , institutions , policy - making , civic engagement instruments , opportunities that are available to all of us thanks to the EU , and so much more ! For me it was very interesting to watch interviews with people whose work is closely connected with the EU ; these videos are absolutely inspiring . Quizzes are designed just right I think they cover the most essential facts one need to know about the EU ) , and peer - graded assignments touch upon some thought - provoking issues and stimulate students ' critical thinking . I would say the course is truly worth taking , both for EU and non - EU citizens .</text>

Easy and quick to do food demonstrations , basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand . Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks , but I guess that is what she wants to stress on .

		<text>With this on - line education , I learned how much health information impacts consumers . Healthcare consumers actively explore health information and make decisions about their health . And they get information via a number of resources such as friends and family , printing , electronic media , health care providers , other consumers and so on . It is very important that health information should be accessible to people and medical staff directly related to patients , and I think that the process of health information delivery should be appropriate to the degree of need of acquiring personal information of medical consumers . In addition , I think that the problem which critical to challenge was examined as long as consumers , providers , and information scientists who develop using health information should go through .</text>

		<text>Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch . Otherwise than that , the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching . I highly recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about game theory !</text>

		<text>Nice course ! It is definitely a beginner ' s course , and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course . I really think there should be an option for people who aren ' t absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and / or do the capstone . After all , this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science , which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners . For what it is , though , namely a very beginning level course to teach the concepts of programming with Python , it ' s very well executed .</text>

		<text>Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures . I ' d placed in the &quot; advance beginner &quot; or &quot; intermediate low &quot; level , therefore , you need to have previous knowledge of Python . As in College , lectures and assignments are somewhat related , but you will spend some additional time investigating by yourself to get the appropriate responses . Again , just like College where Lectures are level 2 - 3 but assignments are level 7 - 8 ( out of 10 ) .</text>

		<text>Beware this course , especially if you are new to this area ( despite what the course / specialization says ) . There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course , but what ' s worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos , so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments / projects satisfactorily or smoothly . I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn ' t paid for this specialization . Beware .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed this course . Professor Holbo developed an effective course for a &quot; philosophy - gentile &quot; like myself . I especially like the Lectures 7 and 8 where Professor Holbo compare and contrast Plato ' s philosophies to two modern empirical scientists . I believe this was a very effective way to get the Platonic lessons through to students . It is also an excellent thought - provoking technique to get people to think about their morality , ethics and spirituality .</text>

		<text>I really enjoyed the course so far . The explanation is great . The only downside is the video quality is not that great its not bad but it would be a lot better if it was better quality . Its very Blurry even in High quality . Although thats not a problem that did not stop me from enjoying the course .</text>

		<text>The only complaint I have about this course is the horribly irritating music at the beginning of each lecture video . I would have my headphones in , volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly , then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly . If I was very quick I could mute my volume until it finished , but I think this is totally unnecessary . PLEASE consider changing this , as it will affect my decision to pursue further courses in this specialization</text>

		<text>This course was really excellent in comparison to many of the other courses in this specialization due to Professor Gavin Brown ' s use of metaphor and analogy to make more complicated content clear and Dr . Peter Keegan ' s interesting insights into taking minorities into consideration in our teaching practices . The case study of the Maori in New Zealand was extremely interesting . If more courses had been like this one , getting through the entire specialization would have been a much more enjoyable task and not nearly as arduous .</text>

		<text>I rate this 3 / 5 because of how accurate it looks . I wish it was more practical and that gave some real explanations ( not just &quot; this concept is called like this . because it is called like this &quot; ) . As I said , anyway , it has a plethora of notions .</text>

		<text>I entered this course with no coding experience , and I can definitely say I am disadvantaged because of it . The lectures are great explanations of the different commands in R , and the projects are a great playground of R ' s different capabilities , but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures . That being said , this course ' s difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programming . Overall , I do not enjoy this course - mainly because it is very difficult . However , the course is structured logically and provides ( what I assume the majority of students ) a comprehensive introduction to R .</text>

		<text>Unacceptable assignments length ! The reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload . It took me 2 weeks ( not 6 hours as tutor mentions ) to complete half of the second assignment and I am about to tell that I learnt nothing about MongoDB . The videos cover the very basics and in order somebody to complete the assignments needs searching in the internet . The videos must change to include more details about the presented topic . I am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course .</text>

Key concepts like JavaScript objects , closures , module pattern and Immediately Invoked Functions are not covered .

I wish there was a bit more programming and practical assignments to accompany this compendium of DSP knowledge . Thanks alot ! great and easy to understand . Finished it within a week if you really get into it . Recommended for beginner !

So overal the course was very good , but negative was that the course was a bit too long I understand Coursera needs to finance the course , so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees . Bu the extra review rounds felt redundant , and because the course was so long it was difficult to keep focussed on it .</text>

Very few practical examples and exercises , but it does cover the basics like : syntax , semantics , what to pay attention to while creating own website . Love the way the material is presented by Mrs . Lent and will finish all three remaining courses . Combined with the HTML &amp; CSS course at CODECADEMY I have the ability to write simple html , read somebody else ' s code and find resources necessary to get me started with my own page .

While the tutors clearly know their stuff , I found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new ( to me ) mathematics or CS that also needed to be grasped . I ' m an experienced professional programmer with the EPFL ' FP in Scala ' and FRP courses under my belt so I thought I knew what to expect but this was much more time consuming than I ' d thought .</text>

		<text>This course feels a lot like it ' s being taught by a non - teaching professor . The lectures are very long , not chunked for easy viewing ( to the point where I couldn ' t download to my phone for offline / off - wifi use ) . There are very long locally - hosted readings ( so they ' re hard to print and you can ' t add them to an offline reader app ) , and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography ( rather than actual reading assignments ) , because there are no links and some refer to &quot; Selections &quot; without giving page numbers or , in at least one case , a multi - volume book . The information is comprehensive and very valuable , but the delivery is very lacking as a MOOC .</text>

		<text>Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not . I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I ' m a boring old sod !</text>

		<text>I took this course with a special interest on the musical aspect , namely the blues , of course . In that regard the course is very superficial , but has some interesting stuff even so . The other aspects of literature , painting , and the more popular arts ( kilts , oral traditions , etc . ) where a nice surprise . This course gives a view of a cultural aspect of America that is very interesting and mostly unknown , particularly , I guess , to a non American . I advise this course to anyone who is interested in ethnology , folklore and popular art and music and is not already familiarized with the American South .</text>

The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education . Its real subject is certain topics in biology , not music . Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student , and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow .</text>

		<text>I found the course informative , interesting and well presented , with two exceptions : a . There was some use of profession - specific terminology / jargon , which is problematic when addressing a target audience from outside the same profession . b . It is repeatedly stated in the course that no two interventions are done the same , and yet only one intervention simulation is used . I would have liked to see multiple simulations covering a range of possible interactions , to afford a more comprehensive understanding of survivor reactions and appropriate intervention responses . All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found myself eager , at the end of each lesson , to get stuck into the next .</text>

		<text>This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste . All in all , it is a pity , that professor Ng does not offer a corresponding specialization . I would enroll immediately .</text>

		<text>A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python . I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures . I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib . functions in order to accomplish tasks . Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U . of Michigan for the course .</text>

		<text>In short presentations , Doug manages to give insightful tools to crafting a fine - tuned poem . He makes learning about rhyme , metaphor and scansion uncomplicated while he hones your focus , so your writing can surprise you . The class exercises and community feedback help create a classroom of learners . I was inspired . For the first time I understood iambic pentameter , trochees and scansion . The best tool was learning how to revise , how to look for the turn in the poem and expand that turn into something unforeseen .</text>

		<text>Loved this course . The lecture videos were very clear , well framed , loved the white background and the instructor was always looking at the camera . The animated illustrations provided made the lecture extremely fun to watch and a lot easier to understand . Barry is an excellent presenter , well spoken , fun , pleasant and speaks in a welcoming tone . What I loved about this course is the nature of the assignments which stressed the point of actually doing negotiations with other classmates , it forced me to interact with complete strangers from different countries and review the work of others , which was an immensely pleasant experience . great . thx to dr oakley for wonderful videos n i liked her style of teaching . always with a smiling face !</text>

		<text>There is absolutely no supervision on this course . My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so , no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as ' late submission ' . I have reviewed 7 papers ( requirement of 3 ) and am shown as being deficient . It is as if I dropped into a void . I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution , questions or help . I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction .</text>

After 20 years it ' s a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me . I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why , or talk in asymptotic notations . Now I can . I didn ' t stop here , I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures .

I found the professor , as well as the assistants delightful , and the language informants were also very exciting to have . It was challenging at a few points despite my background and interest in Linguistics , however , it was well worth the effort . I sincerely hope I can take more courses from Leiden , or perhaps study there one day . This course reaffirmed my interest in Leiden from 10 years ago .</text>

		<text>A good course , giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy , their issues and opportunities . I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date . It really needs to be re - done . The Paris Agreement wasn ' t mentioned , some of the research is from the early 2000s , many of the lectures are at least 3 years old . This is an area that is changing rapidly , monthly , and this course can ' t really be seen to be current any more . Particularly the politics section in week 8 .</text>

		<text>Definitely a &quot; must - take &quot; course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces . The programming assignments may require a learning curve for those who have never used a Matlab / Octave environment , especially using the vectorized operations instead of loops but that is also well worth the time and effort . If you check question - and - answer sites on the Internet , you will probably find that this is the most recommended beginning course for related branches of science and engineering .</text>

		<text>A truly fantastic course . Extremely useful , practical , relevant content and examples , plus such a great teacher as well as very helpful course staff and other students . Thanks Andrew , team and the rest of the students . For anyone considering doing the course , note that the time requirements can be a lot - the lectures are fine but two or three of the assignments took far more than 3 hours ( if you plan on actually battling through the coding this is relevant . I ' d highly recommend that anyone considering doing the course does the assignments since this is where the real magic happens - Andrew quite deviously leaves a bit of the theory to be fully worked out by yourself in the assignments ) .</text>

		<text>The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that . The reason I am ranking this 2 stars is that I felt the quizzes were unreasonably difficult ( or perhaps they had bugs ) . Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn ' t figure out what the correct answer was . Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared . I have taken multiple coursera classes ( Astronomy , Astrobiology , Calculus ) and these are by far the most difficult quizes I have encountered .</text>

In answering how to translate &quot; South , &quot; the answer should be &quot; nánbian , &quot; but when I selected this option , it was marked wrong .

		<text>Great instructor ! Very clear and specific . It helps me a lot on calc one . I recommend it to those who are learning AP calc BC if you really want to skip the calculus in college . I did not do well in AP tests , so I took calc one this semester and it really helps me a lot .</text>

		<text>The topic is interesting , the course content is presented clearly , and the lectures are informative . While the assignments can be challenging , they really help to reenforce the lessons . From what I gather , the class was recently moved over from an older Coursera model / design . This is frustratingly apparent at times . Some information can be difficult to find , particularly in the Discussion section . I would love to see this class updated to match the quality of some more recent classes I have taken .</text>

		<text>This course is a very good introduction to programming in general and covers all the basic concepts that is used in most of the programming languages . The lecturer makes things interesting with a sense of humour . The assignments which comes later on can be a tad difficult for someone new to programming , but as the professor says , stick with it , solve it , and the feeling you get when you finish it is unparalleled . All the doubts and queries in the discussion forums are answered quickly and efficiently . Great course and a great experience over all .</text>

		<text>The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science . At times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting . Will share these observations widely . We are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can . When I was taking this course , my city is going through severe flooding and the country is in yellow alert stage due to abnormal thunder storms .

		<text>This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning . I would have given it 5 stars , but towards the end , I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier . New concepts not thoroughly explained , sloppier slides , and even a lecture video missing at one point ( had to find a link to it on youtube ) ! Still a very solid , instructive course , though .

		<text>This is an excellent code for both beginners and novice programmers who want to improve their problem - solving skills . This course does not only teach the languages but also teaches the best ways to approach a problem , and how to implement our approach into coding . I have learned various image editing techniques , gained domain knowledge and even built my own full website . The only downside is that the javascript libraries which is used in most of the exercises is written by Duke itself so I ' m not sure if I ' ll be able to use them outside the course . But these libraries really helped understand the process .</text>

		<text>I tried other complex Unity3d courses online , and this one beats them all in the way it is built stage by stage . It doesn ' t pile too much information from the start , and lets you use pre - generated complex assests first , and only later explains them gradually . Even though I had some basic tutorial in Unity3d I couldn ' t imagine getting that far within a month , investing only about 3 - 4 hours on the lectures . The projects themselves consume as much time as you want / have to put into , with at least 3 - 4 hours on average , but if you want to really learn and improve your skill , it requires a lot more than that .</text>

		<text>This course gives a good overview of GIS . It helps in becoming familiar with ArcGIS software and also teaches a lot of fundamentals that can be generally applied to different GIS products as well . But looking at the expenses of using ArcGIS for commercial purposes , it would have been great had there been some sort of additional , optional demonstrations of other products . . For a small - medium business , ArcGIS doesn ' t seem viable at all .</text>

I had to do a lot of googling to figure out how to do stuff on my own . All of the assessments are done by the people in the course and I thought people were a little too harsh .

For example not knowing the criteria we would be graded on before submitting the assignments , many students unable to get enough reviews to move forward especially if they had to revise their assignment . Hopefully , this will be worked out for future versions . Overall , it was an interesting process .</text>

The material covered was simply running through each of the menus in Tableau .

		<text>The course provides a sizeable amount of pretty cohesive material , which can still be understood by non - CS students . It ' s very practical and it includes a very nice mix of quiz tests and great MATLAB / Octave programming assignments . After going through the assignments I started wondering about other problems which data sets I can plug with small modifications into the completed solutions . Andrew Ng keeps a great balance between explaining important details and skipping over parts that require straying too much from the main topic of the lecture . I still don ' t have very deep or broad knowledge in the Machine Learning domain , but it feels like the course doesn ' t miss anything of the fundamentals . Overall , I ' d definitely recommend the course to CS students , high - school students with interests in the computer science area and even specialists in other areas with some knowledge in linear algebra with interest in the AI and ML domains .</text>

		<text>The video classes are informative and very clear . The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace . My only problem were the auto - graded exams . Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto - grader isn ' t intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting . Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors .</text>

		<text>The problems are interesting , the course is great . However , the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well - defined , which makes it really difficult to solve ( especially the dataset problem ) . The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple , but is not applicable to a large set of problems , only to the particular dataset that is given ( and the characteristics of this dataset is not given ; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset , which makes the problem more difficult ) . The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly . However , I really appreciate the whole courses , and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses ! Thank you very much !</text>

		<text>Professor Severance is awesome . I really like how each video is an in - depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when . I think his sense of what ' s important is spot on as I ' ve already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects , the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter . The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned . I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week ' s material , especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more . I think more chapters on this in the book could be very helpful though .</text>

		<text>We are getting basic ideas , but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly , with NO examples / limited examples , which is what will teach us the most . Then , we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and it ' s very difficult . Instead , too much time spent on videos of &quot; role playing &quot; - just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them . Furthermore , the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the time . The visuals are the best part of the course .</text>

		<text>This is a fantastic course ! While the content is reasonably technical , it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience . The Teaching is top notch and the material is communicated in a way that is not only engaging but concise and easy to follow . I have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to ! it ' s a good course , helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english . The only problem that i find whit this course isn ' t about the course it ' s about the peer to peer grading , is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes , not in all cases . Also is a short course , the assignments are very simple and that makes it an easy going course , i would recommend it for intermmediate english stundents .</text>

		<text>The course is absolutely fantastic . The instructor and the team are well read , approaching topics from a variety of perspectives . The course uses all kinds of texts and materials . If you are into public law , history and social science , this will be great for you . Even if you are a reasonably advanced student , you will learn a lot , and if you are not - it ' s easy enough for a beginner to understand . Well done .</text>

		<text>I really enjoyed this honest look at the history of Israel as a country . There ' s some dirty laundry on display , and a lot of interesting issues to think about . If you are curious about Israel ' s short and convoluted history , this is a good place to start your studies . My favourite part was the last debate in week 5 ! It got a bit fiery . . . ) My thanks to everyone who made this course possible .</text>

		<text>Great course ! Easy to follow , useful , and very practical . At the same time , if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and / or the math behind it , the lectures give you good directions to look further into it . The programming assignments are a bit on the basic side ( in terms of what you have to do vs what they give you ) , but are still great to put these ideas into a practical setting , and the optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth . Really glad I put the time into it . Totally worth it .</text>

		<text>Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more &quot; visible &quot; support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge . Thank you for your effort !</text>

		<text>Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful , when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn ' t place any emphasis into it . So for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all . Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like &quot; Eat3D &quot; and many others out there , which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here ! It needs to be deeper and more robust if this course wants to stand out , right now is not .</text>

		<text>Great course to explain the fundamentals of Project Finance summarizing key concepts and including some brief examples . Professor Gatti is clearly knowledgeable about the topic and takes great care of being both accurate and synthetic . Course syllabus is also well structured to progressively build an understanding of PF . Improvement points ( there must be a few ones ! ) videos could be made slightly more &quot; natural &quot; , more examples / case studies would be appreciated . Above all , this course would deserve to be complemented by a level 2 entering into more details of modelling and complex examples .</text>

		<text>The content of the class is very nice . It gives a nice overview on genetics , and it was made accessible to many of us . Also , Mohamed Noor is very enthusiastic , and provides a lot of nice examples to illustrate the course . However , I think some parts of the class were a little bit dizorganized . For instance , I was sometimes confused by the vocabulary or the variable notations which are not always clear .</text>

		<text>Good introduction to basics . A few improvements are warranted : Lessons could be reordered in a more logical progression , particularly when it comes to Git . Gitbash is not easy or intuitive . A more structured approach ( e . g . with cheat sheets , command glossaries , structure diagrams , debugging algorithms etc ) would help assimilate it .</text>

		<text>This course is not for beginner programmers . You should have some background on programming ( as a whole ) , you should know object oriented programming concepts and if you want to make the most out of it , I recommend that you have a little knowledge on HTML , CSS and on how the web processes requests ( when you access a website for instance ) . That aside , this course is a great way to learn the basics of both Ruby and Ruby on Rails . I have experience programming on PHP using the web framework Laravel . I enjoyed this course a lot .</text>

		<text>Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months . I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace .</text>

		<text>The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory . However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery . There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor , who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to . A couple of math notations were also incorrect , for example &quot; &lt; &quot; when the professor said &quot; less than or equal to &quot; . Overall though , I ' m pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study . excellent course ! they teach you all the terms and sentences you need to know either as a beginner learning Korean or if you ' re planning to travel there . In addition to the video lessons , lecture notes and homework are also provided for extra practice ! Definitely recommend this course to anyone thinking of learning Korea ! Thank you very much for this course 10 / 10 !</text>

		<text>This was a good overview of the services Google Cloud Platform offers . There were a few bugs with the quizzes , but overall it was put together well and had a lot of information for a short course . I think it is a good introductory - level course for a person who has some background in Data Science and cloud computing , but not much experience with Google Cloud Platform . The tutorials and exercises are quick walk - throughs that can be completed in 10 - 15 minutes each . They give you a feel for how the Google Cloud APIs work and what some of the capabilities are , but don ' t go into much depth . This is an ideal course for a person who is considering using Google Cloud Platform but isn ' t sure what the advantages and capabilities are .</text>

That really shows the power of scala in things like pattern matching ( suddenly , it ' s everywhere ! ) and functional programming approach ( lots of small functions with pretty narrow scopes ) . So althouth you can program just as if it was java , you ' re kinda pushed to do scala . Thanks for the course .</text>

		<text>Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else . I have now started using Lynda instead , and am seeing all the bad habits I ' ve picked up and the holes left in my knowledge . Normally I prefer Lynda to Coursera for the assignments and the quizzes , but not in this case . . .</text>

		<text>The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice . There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with , yet this is a pivotal point in education . The course assumes that Education is a way to change behaviour ( as an external factor ) Yet I am more inclined to the philosophy of : Education is to lift man up from the animal state ; and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world ( internal factor ) . The theory and practice given in this course are still valuable though , regardless of this difference in viewpoint .</text>

		<text>Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about . Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam , its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind . Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic . Some questions on quizzes weren ' t explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week . Other than that , a solid course .</text>

		<text>Great course , really covered so many details ! I really enjoyed this one . This course , together with an intro course , is what I ' ve been really expecting from this specialization . I especially liked the idea with the assignment being given only on the last week of the course . Already recommended those 2 courses .</text>

		<text>I have enjoyed every second of the five - part creative writing specialization . These courses have made me reassess my writing practices , they have allowed me to hone my skills as both a writer and working on the editing process . The course materials were brilliantly developed to support the aspiring writer and the knowledge and writing tips are of a very high caliber . Each guest writer and tutor have given great insight into the writing process and how every writer is different , everybody has their own methods of working . Superb and challenging .</text>

		<text>I think this course gives me the most fundamental knowledge of photography , which consists of many new words and ideas . Thanks to this series of courses , I began to work better on my photograph skills , and I found it really interesting and amazing . The only thing I ' m not quite pleased with is the payment of the full course , without the upgrades I just can ' t review others ' works and that ' s disappointing . But anyway , I will continue this specialism and I hope it ' s the right choice .</text>

		<text>I signed up to audit the first 5 courses in this specialization . This review is for the first 3 of these courses taught by Rebekah May . I don ' t know that SEO is truly simple and logical or if it just appears this way because of how clear and easy to listen to Ms . May is . I do feel she has supplied a lot of very useful information , pointed to a lot of great tools and websites . and am already making improvements as a result of her classes .</text>

		<text>The most terrible course I have ever seen in my life and on this site . For some of quiz questions , you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lectures and quizzes . I really wanted to learn java on coursera but It seems impossible to me . Focusing on rbg values and image thingies too much and making me feel uncomfortable at quizzes after watching all those lectures are the main reasons of giving 1 star .</text>

		<text>I learned a lot of useful information in this course - - my first on Coursera - - and I ' m really excited to see how I will apply the things I learned here in real projects . Although I think that it would be beneficial if the course also required us to submit our code ( not just watch and read ) and also explain github at least a little , I feel that I am well - primed now to acquire more knowledge of how to make apps in the future . I positively adored the instructor ( his accent and way of explanation made it so fun ) . Thanks , Clement ! is a excellent course , I´m a neurosurgeon and I think Dr .

		<text>I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned &quot; alternative &quot; approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs &amp; trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly . I like to get a certificate , but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time .</text>

		<text>The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data . The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code . The auto - grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect . The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data , the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer . Admittedly , I feel this effort forced me to become a better Python programmer .</text>

This course requires some understanding about using Excel , which is quite useful when doing the quiz . Mastering Excel well would save a lot time . Some material might be a little hard but with patience and hardworking , it can still be solved . Highly recommended !</text>

		<text>Some parts are needed more clarification . In other words , as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials , since the materials are not self - sufficient . Specially about simulation methods . However , this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5 . The absence of any help from TAs , based on my experience , is the reason . I expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course .</text>

Don ' t let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent .

		<text>This course wasn ' t good . Many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written , and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them . The assignments also weren ' t very deep or imaginative , and some of them requested very specific answers relying in keywords from the lectures rather than ensuring that the students had really understood the concepts . The design principles were introduced at such a surface level as to be just silly rather than useful . This was kind of a waste of my time .</text>

		<text>Not up to the standard of the previous two courses . The material was already covered in the first course - Fundamentals of Graphic Design - and nothing new was brought to the table . Even the assignments were a re - hash of the ones from the first course . I realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the &quot; making &quot; of multiple iterations of the images . I just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy .</text>

		<text>I ' ve tried the Python course of Rice university , and some part of the Codecademy Python course ! This is much more basic and offer a fundamental view about all programming language not only just python . Compared to the Rice University course , this one is more for a new beginner who hasn ' t done any coding before . The Rice course doesn ' t really need any coding exp , but with the projects get more complicated in the end , it would be much easier if you have somewhat coding exp before , at least in my opinion . Anyway , I can ' t wait for all this specialization of University of Michigan ! inp = raw _ input ( &quot; What do you think of the course ? &quot; ) while True : if inp = = Chuck _ is _ amazing &quot; : breakif len ( inp ) &lt; 1 : breakelse : &quot; You _ do _ not _ understand _ why _ this _ is _ a _ good _ course ! &quot; breakprint &quot; inp &quot;</text>

		<text>This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented . I ' m now eagerly waiting for an updated version of the course , since the recorded lectures are from late 2012 .</text>

		<text>Improvement over the first course . Most of the material did not require many references to the apple documentation in order to complete the assignments . Final project was comprehensive and built on previous work . A major flaw of this course is that it is not updated for the newest version of Swift . Many of the techniques and methods taught will not translate to Swift 3 . 0 .</text>

		<text>This is a great course that is very informative . It brought many performers to my attention that I had not heard of before or that I had not appreciated before and has enriched my appreciation of music . The course focuses mainly on the history and development of rock music , rather than the technical side of the music itself . It is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music , but does not feature the music itself . I suggest that you keep a streaming service , such as Spotify or Deezer , open in a separate window on your browser , so you can pause the lectures and listen to the music as you go along .</text>

Makes a convincing case by linking the historical , geographical , archaeological , and textual evidence . Great lectures and guest lectures . Also provides a case for why studying the bible is important even for secular humanists and atheists . Includes really interesting ideas about the genesis ( pun intended ) of modern conceptions of nations and states .</text>

		<text>This course has been an eye opener for me , I truly enjoyed it . It gives you basic knowledge of what it takes to be a good public speaker , and you can apply this knowledge not only in presentations , but also in your daily life . The most difficult part for me was to make the videos and watch myself , but it really helps in your improvement . Also , the feedback of your classmates makes you see things you haven ' t caught . Try it out , you won ' t regret it .</text>

		<text>Could be better . The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way , and not always shows how to do in practice . But you will get curious and in case of doubts , you can find more simple explanations on the web , and the forum is very good . The assignments are hard , you will need do research to accomplish then , but is the best way to learn . I think the specialization is good to someone without much knowledge on the field ( like me ) . But it ' s only the start !</text>

		<text>The information in the course was really excellent and was set up in a way that it wasn ' t overwhelming . I wish I could give four and a half only because some of the videos explaining procedures were really long and were obsolete , and also because different parts of the site would say that I needed to submit something and others would say that everything was received so it made me really nervous - at one point the site was telling me that I was late in submitted my work and that I ' d need to sign up for a later class but it turns out my assignments had been submitted and graded before the cut off time so that alert just really frazzled me if anything .</text>

		<text>A solid course that delivers what it promises - - the foundations of everyday leadership . As someone who is in their 10th year of leading an organization , I took this class as part of the specialization because I want to make certain I ' m keeping my skills fresh . This course was fun for me , as I recognize many of the things I do every day in it . And I also gained some new skills and insights . I recommend this course for any one who is hoping to move into a leadership position , and for current leaders who are looking for a refresher .</text>

I didn ' t attend the other courses of the specialization but I think that this one summarizes really well the whole specialization . Recommend it ! tl ; dr : I recommend it . Good introduction to macroeconomics . Gives lots of insights and mechanisms . Long course , but it was necessary . A second part would be much appreciated , maybe with more econometrics to give a measure to all these effects .</text>

		<text>The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes , as they are primarily theory and background . The lectures will not , however , aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments . The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures , the textbook , or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment / quiz . There are so many disparate concepts , that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least , demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R . How to properly import the data , create the file , structure the data , and then perform some analysis . These concepts are introduced throughout the course , but never brought together in one complete project .</text>

		<text>The &quot; Soul Beliefs &quot; course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias . If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down , they partially succeeded . Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak . A better title for the course would be &quot; why there is no soul &quot; . That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda .</text>

		<text>The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented . I feel like I learned a lot . However , the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level , and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures . I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material , but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme . If others were interested in learning about the basics of music theory , I would not recommend this course .</text>

		<text>I would advise anyone doing this specialization , to take the Java for Android first , then do the Engineering Maintainable Android apps , as its only in the Engineering Maintainable Android apps that there is an optional coursework to create and test a very simple app for the first time . All the other MOOCs optional courseworks start from very complex pre - existing app examples . I was able to complete these courseworks but I didnt really understand all the surrounding code that did a lot of important UI stuff , or the JUnit test . Its good to be forced to make a simple app and get used to JUnit from day 1 . I did not take this route , but I wish I had .</text>

Otherwise , I enjoyed the class and learned a gread deal .</text>

The course only contained a single project , which although fun , is not enough for learning a new language . After completing this course I feel that I don ' t really know Swift , but I can use it . After each week you have to complete a quiz . They should replace these quizzes with project , where you write real code . I took this course for free , but I wouldn ' t pay for it .</text>

I have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus . It seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again . I got bored by the time I got to week 3 and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments . I hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate . . .</text>

		<text>I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance . Such as real financial close considerations in developed and emerging markets , early stage sub performance and restructuring as well as refinancing . I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects . There were highlights on impacts of Basel on long tenor financing , but more market considerations of new players and structures would have been invaluable .</text>

		<text>Thank you to the instructors and the university ! A very interesting course that not only focuses on the content and quality of Scandinavian TV and movie productions but also on the broader ( institutional and cultural ) framework in which they are produced . I would have rated it 4 . 5 starts if possible , but as halves are not possible I give it 4 . Possible improvements : - the delivery of the course can be a bit livier , smoother ; some instructors seem a bit at unease with this format - while an interest in Scandinavian movies and TV series is an implicit prerequisite for a course like this , sometimes simply mentioning ' lists ' of directors , movies , series you might never have heard of can make it a bit overwhelming , hard to relate to - students ' engagement could be enhanced with more interactive assignments</text>

Moreover , If you ' re following the complete series of courses , you ' d have grasped a good command over stress analysis .

		<text>Nice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering . The playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome . Outside of the necessary downloads , recordings , playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear . Position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the Instructor did a commendable job elaborating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvise . The reason not a 5 is that the grading is cumbersome and time - consuming to set up</text>

		<text>Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site ! I found that the lecturers sometimes used random terminology without ever explaining it for example , &quot; tags &quot; is another word for sequencing reads , but this is only ever used in RNA - seq methodology , and then only rarely ) . Also , the final peer reviewed project isn ' t explained very well and uses tools and methods that aren ' t even within the scope of the module . Mostly just a waste of time .</text>

As a person with severe anxiety who is also a full time student I don ' t have as much time as I would like to focus on these courses but this course was so well compartmentalized and polished that it was a great experience even for me . I really liked how the pace of the assignments is increasing in complexity at a very nice pace .

		<text>The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents . Affirmations are most times not justified at all ( &quot; incremental prototyping will yield a feature - rich and robust software &quot; ) . The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before . The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here . I know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material , but clearly that last effort for quality was not done .</text>

		<text>Unlike the very first course for beginners , there is a little bit more content here , so I put 2 stars . However , I still found the pace was too slow , with too much distraction ( &quot; funny &quot; videos , teacher drinking and making mistakes , hummm ! ! ! ) . It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses , not 5 ( with the capstone ) . I am planning to move forward with Python , and to keep reading the booklet which is good ( I like the introduction about the HTTP , XML , JSON and SQL databases ) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation , it is overpriced for what it is ! !</text>

		<text>This course was truly an excellent way to learn about Einstein ' s Special Theory of Relativity . The content covered most of the main aspects of Special Relativity , and the instructor did a top notch job of explaining how the various aspects of the theory are derived and many implications of the Theory . The maths involved in this course is no more than high - school level algebra with a few tricks , and as such the course should be within most people ' s reach with a bit of effort . Mind you , the concepts themselves are somewhat counter - intuitive , so be prepared to think a lot about the implications . However , all that being said , I highly recommend this course ! It is a very well presented and accessible way to start to grasp Einstein ' s most profound work in his &quot; miracle year &quot; of 1905 .</text>

		<text>Dr . Impey is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of &quot; astronomy &quot; . The slides were clear . The transcripts helped to reinforce the information , although probably done with vocalization software as there are many sentence fragments , homonyms for the actual word , etc . I did not see a date done but I would guess this course was constructed in 2013 - 2014 , so the information is certainly current .</text>

		<text>Good course , very well structured , well signposted , progressive , very clear , with a good use of the media . As for the content , the examples are not always well connected to the theory . The speakers speak at a good pace , not too slow not too fast but their tone is monotonous and it is a little bit formal . Therefore the course is a little dull . As the course is very introductory , it would have been nice to be directed to other more advanced courses either online or residential .</text>

		<text>The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined . I really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money .</text>

		<text>I learn some interesting things . The course gets better for week 3 - 4 . However , the course could use better the Coursera format and strenght . The certified certificate is pricy compared to other courses . In overall it’s good .</text>

		<text>Excellent course with wonderful explanations and illustrations . The team handling the grader technology has done a very good job too . Last but not the least , the forums for discussions have been eye - openers in the case of a few problems . The mentors have promptly replied to queries in the best possible way . 5 stars from me .</text>

		<text>I found this course very useful and learnt how use of regular expressions and later used them to parse HTML pages to look at various tags and content . The use of urllib and BeautifulSoup make my life easier to scrape webpages . Finally , I learnt how to parse XML and JSON . Again , Thank you Dr Chuck and your team for creating such an interesting and exiting course . I have thoroughly enjoyed this .</text>

		<text>This course is the best online course I have heard so far at Coursera . As well it is the best course compared to other learning platforms . This course achieves to introduce to the main concepts and provides an intuitive understanding of machine learning . Without drifting too much into the mathematical foundations still the main ideas are very well presented . I really want to thank Andrew Ng for providing this nice course ! ! !</text>

		<text>This course is amazing ! It really explains the topic in depth and you learn a lot from both professors ! This course also provides a lot of practical information and you know that it ' s evidence based . It ' s definitely worth the time and effort to watch all the videos and I recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn something . More important : This course is mainly focused on academics but it also links the knowledge to everyday learning ( skills like cooking great dishes , learn a sport or any other skill really )</text>

		<text>This course was outstanding ! I learned more from one month of this course than I did while taking a semester of computer science course at my university . Also , the language being taught in this course ( Python ) is much more intuitive than many of the other programming languages I have tried ( C + + and BASIC ) . This course is a must for anyone who wants to learn computer science !</text>

This is also the first class i have taken online . Thank you for your efforts , to give me a graet course . 我觉得这门课挺好的，我从中学到了一些很有用的学习技巧，同时它也给了我一个新的方式去看待学习。这门课改变了我的学习方法，我开始做笔记，每天定计划，尽量多使用recall，创建有用的chunk，尽管这才刚刚开始，不过我想我会从中受益的。感谢所有参与这门课程制作的成员，是你们的努力让我有了这次不错的网上课程体验。同时也要感谢翻译的成员，正是有了中文做参照，才让我能坚持下来，完成课程。Thank you .</text>

		<text>I found this course too advanced for my level of familiarity with statistics . Its true that most basic stuff is covered to be fair , but the progression is very rapid . As I work long hours and other commitments I didn ' t have enough time to dedicate to study beyond the time needed just for this course . If I had been able to study an extra 10 hours a week practicing using the formulas then I ' m sure I would have got more out of it .</text>

		<text>Creative Writing : The Craft of Plot is simply one of the best video courses I have found on the subject . Easy to follow , great examples , clearly explained , engaging presentations and assignments , tips from the experts ; all those things made this one course I couldn ' t &quot; put down &quot; . Brando Skyhorse comes across as a phenomenal teacher who really knows his subject and truly cares about it , that alone makes the course worth watching . I will definitely be referring back to this again . Keep an eye on the dedication should my novel ever hit the shelves !</text>

All the lectures look extremely thought out , topics are presented in somewhat funny , but really professional way , quizes are sometimes challenging , but that ' s great ! . If you struggle with Calculus , you should definitely take this course . But it ' s also great for people that like Math in general - I ' ve passed my Calculus stuff long ago , but wanted to recover that knowledge to enter different programming areas and that was one of the best thing I did last year .

		<text>The course is interesting and might be useful for complete strangers in the world of fitness / physical activity , as it provides some general ideas about implementing activity to one ' s daily life , as well as gives a good understanding on stating achievable goals . For those who have the essential knowledge of all that , the course would be a repetition of the basics . The most useful part seems to be about the goal setting , and that is what I ' d recommend to start with for most students . The course won ' t be useful for fitness \ sports professionals . Follow - up e - mails for many months after the course ends seem to start turning somewhat annoying . The quality on the videos ( sound especially ) is often a bit on the poor side .</text>

		<text>Great course . Lot of complicated detail segmented and described in a way that was easy to digest . Thoughts for improvement are with the first few segments . The lessons didn ' t start with the &quot; why &quot; . Why machine learning is used or what problem it solved . I had to google that in order to understand before the course which started with &quot; what &quot; it was . the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe . It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works it ' s clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course ) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done . further to the course timeframe ) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions , which is very strange in a course for coaching . Not the mention video quality that is scary , I could not watch the videos , and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions .</text>

		<text>Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .</text>

		<text>I really appreciate the approach which was taken to present such a delicate topic , but still there are some mistakes which shouldn ' t had happened . Like the year of Einstein ' s death according to common known history is not 1995 . Also , many times , English subtitles are not correct , I have a feeling that machine has done it . Sometimes there is no understanding of content just the closest word to the sound produced was used . In any case , it is worth of my time , I will recommend it . Students are also provides with plenty of additional materials and when one has more time can study</text>

		<text>I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments . It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors / teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues , especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people . But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues . Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study .</text>

		<text>Professor Wright tells things simply - and in a straightforward manner , even some of the more complex ideas , he explains eruditely . Prof . Wright offers many helpful resources , including third - party experts , the readings , articles , videos , and office hours in particular really help enrich the subject matter . I would recommend this course to any one who has even peripheral interest in psychology or buddhism , meditation , and the scientific implications of the practice . Thank you for offering this course !</text>

		<text>As an introduction to GIS , I thought this was excellent . I do wish it had been more in depth regarding data types , how to integrate ( for example raster data ) the different types . It ' s also obvious that the sheer number of tools available is huge . In other words , I ' ve got a lot to look forward to in upcoming courses and I hope I can learn enough to become a GIS professional .</text>

		<text>An excellent course that really does provide you a challenge . Some of the courses I have done on different MOOCs were rather too easy , but this one did push me a lot . It informs you in a clear , but detailed manner . It is necessary to do extra reading and to review videos and notes in order to complete assignments . Best course yet</text>

		<text>Excellent course , I highly reccomend it ! Passionate John Covach makes it very thrilling and you really learn a lot . Do not expect an easy course , in the way that you have to take notes during the lessons - and even better , you have to take the aid of Youtube and / or Spotify or similars to really take advantage of the course . It takes time .</text>

		<text>I am only on Week 3 of this course and so far I am thoroughly enjoying it . The videos are informative and well put together . Very interesting to learn about the history of the internet and how it has evolved . I currently work for an smaller ISP in Northern Alberta and after stumbling into this job , I ended up loving networking and computers . This really helps with an introduction to some fundamental concepts of the internet . Thank you for providing this course .</text>

So much of what I think I know has been informed by these ancient Greek philosophers . I love that the course is also really hard - it has not been dumbed down for us . I feel I really need to do it a few times to grasp all that is being offered . That is a good thing .</text>

		<text>A great course to get started with programming in general and with Python in particular . As stated in the abstract , this course is addressed to those who have no experience in programming . However , even if you have some experience but are not familiar with Python ( as it was my case ) , you can take this course quickly ( speed x1 . 50 ) in order to learn the basic sintax of Python and catch up for the following courses in the specialization . Really clear teacher . Highly recommended !</text>

		<text>Dog Emotion and Cognition is a clear , well - structured course with some wonderful ' added extras ' that really help round out the MOOC experience . Dr Hare ' s enthusiasm for the subject is infectious and the material presented is more wide - ranging than I had anticipated - - again , adding to the experience . I have learned a fair amount about my dog , which has been fascinating , but have also learned about dog cognition against a wider species - comparative context , which has strengthened my understanding considerably . A superb course ( and the accompanying book , The Genius of Dogs , and citizen science website , Dognition , are wonderful too ) . Thanks Dr Hare , Duke and Coursera !</text>

		<text>It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , &quot; What is Love &quot; session clearly depends an individual ' s own view . It contradicts &quot; triangular theory of love &quot; and the lecturer doesn ' t even explain why .</text>

		<text>Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program , especially in a self - directed / self - motivated way . This course taught by Dr . Chuck was broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested , and I could follow along easily , with just the right amount of complexity in the quizzes and chapter exercises , so as not to discourage me . I ' ve tried to learn computer programming using Java ( inside &amp; outside of a tertiary environment ) with very limited success , but switched to learning python because it seemed more intuitive . So while i ' m not a complete &quot; novice &quot; to programming , this course had the &quot; Goldilocks Effect &quot; for me . &quot; Just right &quot; : D</text>

It was an eye opener for as to how business is done and things are made to look so simple in the module by just having a systematic approach to risk and risk mitigation whilst developing a business .

		<text>While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well . I just wish I didn ' t have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open - ended questions .</text>

		<text>Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .</text>

I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video . Professor Ang explains the material very clearly . I always walked away feeling that any questions I might have were answered completely in the videos or in the discussions . I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a good understanding of Machine Learning .</text>

		<text>Really good course , I recommend it to anyone working in the MENA region as a journalist , or business person . Great presentation of the subject . Professor Afsah ' s teaching style , insights and critical theory approach combined with pragmatic reflections is very enlightening and useful for me as a journalist working in Islamic nations . I like the recap checks mid lesson , that ' s useful , as I ' m working and get tired , so it ' s a good check on my own concentration levels .</text>

		<text>In this course , I see the future of education . It is light years ahead of any other course I ' ve taken on Cousera or EdX , as the instructor has developed a web pedagogy that gives the course the feel of seminar - based instruction at a top - tier brick and mortar institution of higher education . In this course , students become members of a lively learning community that is always on .

		<text>Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help . I ' m sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course , but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience .</text>

		<text>This class ' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course . The teachers , while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields , fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon . I ' m not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren ' t used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them . As someone who was taking this class without that advantage , I was quickly lost among all the jargon , to the point where I just had to stop . I ' m hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background .</text>

		<text>It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience . Other than swirl , it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before . I worked hard to be able to follow it , but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were , I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it . Disappointing .</text>

		<text>I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing . I would still recommend this course , but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors .</text>

		<text>This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism . Yes , the assignments require immersing oneself in problems that have little to do with parallelism per se . But they are interesting , fun , and of course they nicely illustrate the concepts that are being imparted . Another excellent course by EPFL .</text>

		<text>While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project , I didn ' t feel like the assignment ' s requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series . As someone who bought this course as one large pack ( four courses , one capstone project ) , it would ' ve been nice to see more intersection . I felt a little &quot; in the dark &quot; on some of this . Given the short timeline to finish the work , too , many of these requests need more time ( e . g . building personas needs user research , ideally ) . All in all , a good challenge to a content professional , but don ' t expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series .</text>

		<text>Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .</text>

		<text>This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit . I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall . The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall . i . e . questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey .</text>

		<text>Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language . I would also like to have more tests / exercises with feedback , probably some review tests covering previous lessons .</text>

		<text>Great ! This is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student . It provides a chance for us to study different type of machine learning algorithm . The assignment also gives you a chance to practice these algorithms on some application example . If this course can provide more deeply mathematics algorithm or guideline for future study on learning algorithm , it will be a perfect course !</text>

		<text>The material in this course is very interesting . I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms . I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry - level manner - it will take some hands - on practice with real datasets to build expertise , understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base . I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming . I completed the Python for Everybody specialization , but still struggled with the programming in this course .</text>

		<text>If you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them , grab some popcorn and take this course , because , hey , it’s about cool robots ! ! If you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate , I would not recommend to participate in this course . The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about . But there are a bunch of quizzes , which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right . I managed to solve all quizzes in the end , but it was some kind of a frustrating and discouraging process .</text>

		<text>When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great . However , towards the end of the course I found that it got boring and not that stimulating . Maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter .</text>

I would have preferred to have been forced to do the optional assignment as it takes that little bit of extra motivation coming up to Christmas to do these optional assignments . I still plan to do them but being forced to do them to get a pass would help . Otherwise I really like what I learning and how its presented . Just need to use it somehow to get a job !</text>

		<text>The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .</text>

		<text>The course was very fruitful . It is was not that easy of course , I think it is one of the most difficult courses on Coursera but it deserves to try it once , twice and as many as you can until you understand the idea behind the course . The exams and the honor assignments were so tricky and not that easy to solve . If you don ' t have a probabilistic background , I think first better for you to take a course in data analysis and probability .</text>

Additionally , the presented materials and the lecture format are very uninspiring .</text>

The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go , the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course .</text>

		<text>Wayne comes across as very enthusiastic and likable . The course material is interesting . It does feel like the course if artificially stretched out a bit too long , though . The material and exercises seem to get repetitive after week 3 , when the pattern has been established to sum up all forces , and then to sum up all cross - products . Nevertheless , this is an introductory course , so too much depth can not be expected . As an introduction , it was a great experience .</text>

Also the very last section is entirely made of a rushed - maths lesson , and a quiz based on that rushed maths lesson that is VERY difficult . I would highly recommend this for anyone who already knows basic Astronomy Math , and caution anyone who doesn ' t .</text>

		<text>By the end of the course , you do start to develop the &quot; hacker mentality &quot; the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are &quot; core concepts &quot; , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .</text>

The quizzes aren ' t that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more . i love this program . it has developed me more on how to approach a subject or course . . kudos to Dr . Barbara Oakley . . . u are a good teacher one of the best courses I ever learned , each topic explained very thoroughly . I liked the dictionary section and file section very much . guess tuples are easy , but are underdogs , they can be game changers in next lessons . Thank you Dr . Chunk</text>

		<text>I feel robbed . I did not get any feedback on my work . Only a classmate gave their ok &quot; yes , there is something written &quot; . I did not follow the course to get a &quot; certificate &quot; but to learn and to revceive feedback . If you don ' t have a special purpose for the certificate - don ' t pay a cent for this .</text>

		<text>Excellent class , and an even better interface now that it changed to always available . Prof . Noor explains with such clarity that even a 5 year old can learn about DNA . This is my 2nd time taking this class , and I ' ve seen already many positive changes in this 1st week alone . Thank you Coursera , Duke University , all participants in general , and a very special thank you to Prof . Noor , your contagious love for science spreads like wild fire .</text>

		<text>Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization , it ' s a bit of a bait - and - switch . Prof Aarabi is an award - winning professor at U of Toronto , but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material . Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he ' s a terrible instructor . I previously took the Android Specialization , which was excellent , so I was shocked at how bad this course was .</text>

		<text>Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? ! In addition , you can ' t participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself . I would prefer to add to a thread than go in blind to each forum</text>

		<text>This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on . I still made an attempt to watch the course content , but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance . Two stars for quality video production . Aside from that , I was unable to find much value .</text>

		<text>The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition . The graphics and didactic material is very good . I would suggest that Dr . Maya improve on her cooking skills ( cutting and chopping ) , It takes too long to do every task and she must use appropriate tools . also , measurements are very important in the kitchen to be disregarded as she does . Remember , she might be teaching to people that have not cook at all . Cooking without measuring is for an expert or a least for somebody with some cooking experience .</text>

Sometimes you ' d have to go an extra mile and find some external materials on particular topic to fully understand it but I ' d say it ' s a good thing . I would recommend that course to anyone who knows that game theory exists but never really had a chance to explore it in more detail .</text>

		<text>Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded . That was a sour point to the overall positive structure of the course .</text>

		<text>Overall this was a good course . Some of the presenters need to work on their presentation skills ( personally I had no problems with the accents ) . I also felt that the sections on dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed and I needed to spend a bit of time researching this on third parties before I felt comfortable completing the exercises . The grading system was really cool and the exercises seemed well thought - out and thorough . I ' d recommend this course to existing developers without a computer science background . Those who want more mathematical rigour should look into the Tim Roughgarden / Stanford course .</text>

		<text>The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .</text>

		<text>This is a pretty good intro to Excel course . It gets a little patchy in Weeks 3 and 4 ( it seems like some of the worksheets weren ' t checked for errors ) , but it never wastes your time . It ' s a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonly - used professional functions in Excel . I ' m glad I took it , though I do wish there had been more of a progression . For example , it would have been nice if there was a final , project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in Week 4 .</text>

		<text>To be completely honest , I was expecting more from this course . One big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on , and instead jumps straight into algorithms . This might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code . I , on the other side , have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms , but when Pavel mentions gene expression and transcription I have a very vague idea what he is talking about .</text>

Plenty of content and knowledge are coved in this course . I learned a lot of basic conducting skills which are fundamental to my dream of being an orchestral conductor . I strongly recommend you to take this course .</text>

		<text>A great soft start into Python . Being used to other programming languages ( JS , PHP , a little bit of Java ) and comfortable reading online documentation and finding answers in StackOverflow , I found this course very easy to complete within just a few days . Small difficulties with the grader interface at first , solved in the forum . Suggestion : include Python &quot; List Comprehension &quot; in the course . Dear Bill , thank you very much for the course and support ! Now I ' m looking forward to dive into Machine Learning !</text>

		<text>This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices . Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student . That being said , a programming newbie should have no problem following it . The professor speaks slower than necessary . 1 . 75x or 2x speeds make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow . In addition , it uses an old version of Python , which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying .</text>

		<text>When I was in a physical classroom I wish I had a Professor like Ed . He was motivating from the very start when I sampled the course and he is the reason why I enrolled and ultimately why I completed the course and applied for the certificate . I learned a lot that I can apply to my business . Thanks Ed see you in Part 2 !</text>

		<text>Dr . Severance is great . He introduces you to coding in a way that is non - intimidating and feels completely natural within a couple of weeks . Instead of dreading class I found myself excited about attending everyday and was able to progress faster than the course outline due to his extremely clear and supportive teaching method . I ' m already reading data from files and it isn ' t even covered until the next course . If you take this class , read the book and you will do well .</text>

I really think this helpted me understand my dog in a different way , but I do wish there had been more studies / facts about dogs ( longer course I guess ) .

The instructor Andrew Ng carries you through the material in easy to understand lectures that are divided by topic in perfectly timed video sessions with individual quizzes during each video that help you gauge how well you have understood and grasped the topic discussed in the lesson . This prepares you to take the graded quizzes and complete the programming projects . The programming projects have great documentation that enhance the learning experience and illustrate applications of the material just learned . I greatly recommend this course !</text>

		<text>Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX , it is still very underwhelming . Priced at £39 , the course materials that are spread to 5 weeks could easily be done in 1 or maximum 2 weeks . It is hard to justify that for example &quot; week &quot; 5 consists of a 7mins long video and a simple quiz . . . Week &quot; 4 is 15mins . Overall , I felt let down by the lack of materials and assignments ( no hand - on experience can be gained , no peer - graded assignments ) .</text>

		<text>Thanks Professor Hare and Coursera since I do enjoy this amazing course which challenges many stereotypes . For example , dogs evolved from wolves not because of human ' s intentional domestication but due to &quot; self - domestication &quot; 12 - 15000 ago . Also , it is generally regarded that certain breeds of dogs are smarted than other . However , in this course , Professor Hare points out that cognition involves many types of intelligence rather than one and there is even tremendous variation within a dog breed in temperament , behavior and especially cognition . Strongly recommend this course especially when you ca n taste this class with your own dog !</text>

		<text>The instructor might be a good web developer , but neither she nor anyone else on her team know how to write a parser . Unfortunately , that is exactly what they attempted to do for grading Final Projects . Unless you are ready to suffer through several hours of tearing your hair out because their parser does not accept perfectly written code , don ' t take this course . The only thing you ' ll learn through the experience is that some people should stay as far away from writing autograders as the planet would allow them . Additionally , the information presented in this course is available in several better structured and presented versions both on Coursera and other MOOC platforms . So you don ' t need this course in particular in order to learn the material .</text>

		<text>The course does a great job of curating very relevant videos and articles to understand digital from a 360 degree perspective . While all of us are exposed to digital from a consumer perspective , looking at it from an entrepreneur ' s and investors ' perspectives completed the picture in my head . I liked the short video format , it is engaging and easier to schedule into our lives . Some of the readings were called &quot; not mandatory &quot; but were needed for answering the quiz ! I would request not to have really long readings - some of them were very intensive papers written as part of an academic exercise and I will be surprised if any of the students , who are looking for many small and engaging materials would be interested in tackling really long non - man</text>

		<text>This was a very good intro course . Some additions that could be applied may include : describing different types of motions ( interrogatives , cross motions ) ; types of judgments ( proscriptions , summary judgments , enjoinment ) , types of memoranda , or even a FOIA request . Maybe a look into work product privilege , protected documentation , principles of discovery . And finally , a little intro into the art of using case law as an event or test , for example ; in &quot; Miranda &quot; , &quot; Keller &quot; , &quot; Brown &quot; , or the &quot; McDonnell Douglas test &quot; . I understand this is just an intro , but if these things could be fit in somehow that would be cool .</text>

		<text>Great course , definitely a complete introduction to crypto - currencies . Lectures are great and assignments interesting and insightful . Keep them coming ! ! ! I would have only one recommendation : Try making a certificate course , and for example , the final exam would be to create a simplified cyptocurrency from scratch : )</text>

		<text>Thank you professor Jogesh K Muppala . This is one of the best courses in the UI domain and any one interested must attend . The best part was the hands on teaching methodology and added to this the spice up was &quot; What mistake I made &quot; - learn and correct by validating other participants work . I enjoyed it . . . . : ) Apologies for always been the late latif in submissions . . .</text>

		<text>This course is totally perfect for newbie of programming ! I am a designer and I am learning programming by myself and I have tried code . org , codacademy . com , and even meet - up for studying . But these didn ' t contribute to improve my programming skill a lot . Finally , I found this course and it worked ! I got essential fundamental knowledge as well as practical and useful tips !</text>

		<text>Pros : Effort has been taken in putting up the assignments . Cons : Quality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through . Instructors have rushed to present course material . I would not recommend this course . Princeton and Stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topics .</text>

The interactive slides are a great way of explaining more complex topics as opposed to &quot; reading &quot; what ' s on slides , which some teachers unfortunately tend to do . I found this course incredibly valuable , easy to follow and incredibly satisfactory in the end . Mr Andrew , thank you !</text>

		<text>Great course series that forced me to take some steps ( design docs ) that I ' d normally skimp on , and in doing so , realizing their true value . Throughout Coursera I ' d love to see more instructor involvement in the courses . The 100 % peer review system is a double edge sword . On one hand , I never felt I had an instructor looking at my work , but on the other hand , where else can you get constructive critiques on the internet ; - ) Overall , great experience . Star - - for feeling a little bit on rails , and not feeling the instructor involvement .</text>

		<text>This has been an exceptional course . I have really enjoyed it as an introductory course to Korean , because it does a good job of teaching the basics without trenching too much in the details . I believe that in beginning stages a learner should not boggle themselves down too much with the details of a language . With time and exposure details are learned . Our instructor was easy to comprehend in her English pronunciation ; she was professional , and she seem to enjoy the topic . I feel confident in the foundation that has been set for me and therefore , I am confident to continue what I hope will become a lifetime journey of enjoying and learning Korean .</text>

		<text>I saw this course recommended by a commenter on hacker news . It is really an amazing course . Because I ' ve read a lot about the topic previously , most of the ideas were not new to me , but some definitely were , and the presentation just explained everything extremely concisely and linked everything together brilliantly . It had one great idea after another after another , with lots of information packed tightly in a small space ( moreso since I watched it at 2x with closed captions ) . I got a lot out of this and took a bunch of notes , and am eager to try many ideas in practice , especially the ones having to do with procrastination , product / process , and the reward step for habits .</text>

		<text>A good entry level course on modern and contemporary art . The themed approach works well and the artists are chosen carefully to give a broad overview of the subject . The additional reading material ( some optional , other not ) allows you to take your understanding to a slightly higher level . I think MoMA have used their resources well . The videos are well made , their collection provides a rich vein to tap into and their access to leading voices in the field is exceptional .</text>

		<text>As others have said , the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials . However , the capstone project was a waste of time . Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me . In addition , the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1 / 3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all . This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses . I expected a lot more from a Wharton - led course - very disappointing .</text>

		<text>I really liked this course . Although some of it depended too much on pre - made scripts it was at the level of games that make sense to a beginner without being to complex ( like all of Unity ' s own tutorials are ) . Sometimes , it went to fast and I was quickly switching from Unity to Coursera to hit the &quot; pause &quot; button to give me time to catch up . I thought that it took way to long to download other participants work in order to evaluate it , but I think that is an issue with Coursera and not with this course .</text>

		<text>In some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in R Programming . That ' s very little value for money . The final course project again feels like it ' s done in a rush and without another review : The submitted dataset should be automatically checked . It ' s simply impossible to derive from it whether the student did everything right , but it could be easily done programmatically . Some of the questions have wording and grammar issues that make it hard to understand . Also there is slightly contradicting instructions between the task and review description .</text>

		<text>The course is delivered in a simple manner , easy to follow and with clear instructions . I ' m not sure how much a peer review is a valuable contribution once most of the students don ' t really know how to criticize properly the peer ' s assignment , either always giving the full mark or evaluating according to its personal ideas and not necessary what the exercises called for . Anyway , it ' s still a very valuable alternative to formal education , specially if the student is committed enough .</text>

		<text>I loved this course and Dr . Chuck makes it easy to follow . I have prior programming experience , but was self - taught , so this helped structure some of my learnings . My only suggestion is to use a different color instead of white on neon for the blackboard drawings to make them easier to see . Other than that , I give this course 5 stars . I ' m looking forward to my next course in the Python specialization series .</text>

		<text>I very much recommend taking this course . It presents basic neuroscience topics as they relate to learning , memory and test taking in a simple and approachable way . It also encourages you to reflect often throughout the course so that you think of ways to apply the concepts to your own experiences . The instructor is an expert and is a great speaker that keeps you engaged . I enjoyed listening to the videos while driving my car , and because of the course ' s good structure and assessments , feel I internalized much of the information well .</text>

		<text>This course delivers a great learning experience . I have not only learned the theory of object oriented design through java . I have also gained hands on experience of these challenging concepts through the java programming assignments . An outstanding feature of this course is the ability of the three professors to relate rigorous theory to hands on experience by means of the java assignments . Hats off to three outstanding Computer Science professors for the great teaching , enthusiasm and ability to motivate me the learner . This course delivers 100 % on its promise to provide a solid foundation in object oriented design and programming through java .</text>

The bioinformatics tools discussed in this course are very helpful and explained in a clear manner . The instructor provides a lot of useful tips . In all , this course touches upon each of the major fields of bioinformatics that any student entering the field should know . It is suitable for those who are knew to this field , and also fascinating for those who have some prior knowledge .</text>

		<text>There ' s a lot of great information in this course and it ' s presented in a very good way . However , like the excel course in this specialization , most of the material isn ' t about using Tableau . 1 week is about running a project , 2 weeks are about using Tableau , and the final 2 weeks are about presentation . If you ' re interest isn ' t mainly in Tableau , I would recommend the course . However , if you ' re taking this course to learn Tableau , I would suggest not paying for it .</text>

		<text>This is a highly recommended course and the content is second to no other on Coursera at the time of this review . I have taken all of the courses in the series from Copenhagen Business School , as well as nearly all other business management courses offered for other institutions . This specific course on Strategic Management is the single most informative and current material of all of the options . It does not answer every question or address every concept you would need to know to run a major corporation , but it is a fantastic overview of past and present methods of business strategy , and is of value to any business minded individual . I highly recommend this course and the entire series from CBS . Enjoy !</text>

So If something you read or heard raised your interest in machine learning and wanted to learn it , this is the perfect introductory course for that . It was a pleasure to learn from Andrew Ng . The course uses Octave / Matlab for the programming exercises , but hopefully they will change it to python as it ' s better suited for beginners .

		<text>I did this course last year , and consider it to be among the very best I have seen . It is great to have such a diverse group of lecturers , everyone of whom know that material very well ; they are great presenters also . If I had been asked , before I took the course , about summarizing 4 billion years in 10 weeks ( 400 million years per week ) , I ' d have said it was impossible . These guys actually did it , and they did it well ! I like the overlap between lectures , as each lecturer had their own style , and sometimes a topic was covered from two different perspectives , which reinforced my knowledge . I ' m only sorry that I can ' t give this course more than 5 stars !</text>

		<text>Highly recommend . A clear , practical and well presented overview of the digital marketing field , with an emphasis on the equal playing field : Kevin makes an effort to provide free resources and tools so that any marketer may use the power of digital analytics unhampered by resource limitations . Which is a good thing because marketers often work with budget constraints . Convincing companies to invest more in marketing , which can be a long term strategy , may not always be easy . The course covers basic concepts , ethics , history as well as practical methods . A very useful addition to my marketing knowledge base , and toolbox .</text>

		<text>The most valuable insight was at the end . We can be so focused on efficiency of solar conversion that we forget it is not the only factor in producing a useful product . I know this but the specific example embeds the insight to better use it in other situations . Overall the course gave a good overview , though it was a mixture of the very simple ( calculations ) and difficult ( the explanation of the polymers ) that needed more pointers to appropriate further reading . Useful to know that the effect of cell shadowing in the series cells has a small effect on output . I hope the project gets funding to continue the research .</text>

The time schedule is tough , but you can easily switch to the next session to have more time . The only aspect that I would change is the technical level of ( some of ) the lectures : sometimes they are even too easy , and a lot of time is used to explain very basic stuff . Maybe some ' optional ' lectures might be added on</text>

		<text>Very generic advice although the interviews with children ' s writers were illuminating and helpful . The marking system was inaccurate , for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn ' t ! Good , solid advice about setting character , scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer ' s block . The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience . Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist .</text>

Masterfully taught , very well structured course that makes optimal use of the online teaching format , and teaches a lot of actually applicable skills if one ' s willing to put in the effort . I ' m kind of at a loss for superlatives reallyI would say it was pure joy taking the course , but there were at least 10 % frustration about my code not working or my brain refusing to understand some formula or other . Obviously those moments were worth no less , probably much more than the purely enjoyable and interesting ones in terms of knowledge and skills acquired . Anyone who is relatively new to machine learning - this is the perfect crash course introduction .</text>

		<text>Very interesting and enjoyable . There is much to contemplate in this rich dense course . I think I ' ll do it again and extract even more now that I ' ve been through it once . I find the material consistent with my own practice of mindfulness meditation , and with my studies in psychology . Thank you for a wonderful and stimulating experience . I am recommending it to family and friends so we can discuss this matter in greater depth .</text>

		<text>First of all thank you for making the course . I liked the structure of the course and the material covered satisfied what I wanted from an introductory course . I also liked the fact that the course is self paced and one can join at any time . In short good course with interesting examples from the professor . I recommend to anybody who is curious about microeconomics .</text>

		<text>The course was challenging , and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures , and a bit more practice on using the basic functions , I learned a lot . I thought the video lectures were a little sparse . There were only 20 - 30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit . More examples in video lectures would have helped . I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture . So overall , the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python ( but moderately experienced in C programming ) , and although I would have liked a bit more guidance , I learned a lot .</text>

		<text>Excellent course ! As close as it comes to a course on the meaning of life . I ' ve learned so much and loved every minute . This course has helped me to know myself a lot better , and to understand others , and the human condition in general . I feel as if it ' s also helped me to solve a couple of life ' s great mysteries , and at the same time introduced me to a lot more great unsolved mysteries . Everyone should do this course ( all three modules ) !</text>

		<text>Good course on the whole , learned a lot and enjoyed it , but it would need to be updated and corrected ( certain bits of code don ' t work as they did when the course was produced , which can be pretty confusing ) . Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed , and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful . Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity , keep it up ! Cheers</text>

		<text>Well , after the regression course , which I actually found interesting , the classification course doesn ' t look so good . The programming assignments are mostly pointless . The use of graphlab doesn ' t make it better . The info presented in this course is rather superficial . If you ' re entirely new to machine learning , you could find some value in this course . If not , go buy a good book .</text>

		<text>It was one of the best courses I have taken so far and the instructor for this course Mr . Yaakov Chaikin is one of the best teachers . This course starts from the very basics and touches even very advanced topics before you even know . This course is complete in itself and encompasses all the topics that might be required at the time of practical implementation and makes you ready enough that you can start building a website from the scratch just after it ' s completion .</text>

		<text>For me , a really nice combination of1 . a theoretical overview of database and data processing concepts , MapReduce and the most important implementations of the various concepts ( SQL and NoSQL databases ) , 2 . practical application of these concepts in real - world programming exercises . I like the way Bill explains , and I like the exercises - however , to complete those , you need to be ready to learn the technology on your own , the lectures are NOT about learning the technology ( Python programming etc . ) to do the exercises . For me , that ' s fine , but for people who have little or no programming experience it might be frustrating . So , if you like the combined approach of this course , I can really recommend it !</text>

		<text>This course gave a great opportunity to explore one ' s creativity , with assignments that didn ' t require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression . However , I also found that it didn ' t give me the richness of principles and techniques that I ' ve found in other courses in this sequence . I expect that , for an in - person course , this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content . In a peer review situation , the feedback is quite general and so doesn ' t take up the slack from the lectures . I suggest that Coursera work with the instructor to retain the current content , but produce much richer lectures that have concepts and principles which students can put into practice even after the course ends .</text>

		<text>In terms of Theory for General Software Architecture this Course is a good refresher for a person who is working with Software Architecture already . The Course could have more focused on IoT specific scenarios compared to Generic Software Architecture . What i recommend is to change the course title and have a separate one for IoT specific matters . If the presenters can provide more practical examples that will help remember how and where we can apply these scenarios . Overall this course content is good and interesting to watch .</text>

		<text>Not a beginner course . You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab . Some of the equations presented don ' t have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied . I have a background in electrical engineering , and I studied control systems in undergrad , so I was able to get by . If you can ' t manage through this course , don ' t feel like you aren ' t smart enough to complete it ; rather , you just don ' t have the proper pre - requisites .</text>

People evaluating others performances , themselves don ' t know how they are suppose to evaluate . Grading must be done by Professor . All other ISB modules are far better on Course ERA , except this one . No offence , but it ' s true .</text>

		<text>I like this course , but for me it was a little bit harder to understand some basic stuff . Ie , in JSON for me was confusing to hear &quot; a list of dictionaries &quot; . Furthermore I didn ' t know what kind of operations I need to apply to them - - therefore I was checking for types of integers and even &quot; brute forcing &quot; a combinations of possible operations . As I have finished this course , I ' l definitely check again previous chapters to build a better fundamentals in my head . Thank you dr Chuck !</text>

		<text>I am a Medical graduate with a keen interest in Diabetes . I took this course hoping to streamline my understanding of the process of innovation . I must say that the course helped me organise the often overwhelming amount of information that is to be understood in this process . It also helped me develop a grounded overview to learn further . The supplementary resources provided for reading were also very valuable . Deepest gratitude !</text>

		<text>This course gives a good introduction on how to develop an application . It gives all the available tools in the field out for us to try and use them . The course is enjoyable and not stressful . I find the assignment as meant to get us to do the project and not really there to fail us . It is difficult to fail to course as only the minimum is required .</text>

		<text>Mapping of software product manager to scrum master is IMHO not correct . Some misunderstanding by introduction of scrum ( e . g . customer is not a part of the scrum team ) . Preparing of a part of an university course by a bachelor of computer science . you must use the exact format to get the correct answer on problems , or it will be marked wrongthe course is &quot; as is &quot; meaning when there are mistakes in the coursework neither web hosting nor faculty have are available to correct mistakesmoderators are not allowed to correct course content , so what they end up doing is editing your post in the forum . get use to this : &quot; A moderator deleted your post in Calculus One because of spam &quot; &quot; Review our forum Code of Conduct to learn more about guidelines for participating in course discussions &quot; , but i and others are only posting problem areas , thus rendering the forum discussions uselesssince the moderators only have the power to delete and edit your post , there is a list of content errors for the course that you will need to look at . real smart . i asked to have my grade adjusted , but they deleted that post also</text>

		<text>This course is very good at explaining both how and why you would do things a certain way in Unity , something that is missing from most of the tutorials you can find out on the Internet . The professor explains concepts behind why you need to use certain components instead of just giving a list of things to match up to replicate the projects . I ' ve rated it 4 out of 5 stars not based on the content , but because the response time , interaction , and feedback could be improved upon . The content is definitely 5 of 5 . I took this during the first run of the course , so I ' m sure that the course staff will improve on this in the future once they get a bit more used to running a MOOC on Coursera .</text>

		<text>I would not recommend this course . The content is very relevant to the subject matter . However , the lectures are much longer than they need to be , and filled with unnecessary commentary . The instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself . The delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walk - through of the equation at hand .</text>

		<text>If you do not know R studio or R programming this course will be very difficult for you . The fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable . Week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions . Their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer . I ' m very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because I do not have the time to figure out how to program in R .</text>

		<text>Huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed , even if you submit before deadline . Course content is not substantiated with research . Assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned , which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignments from earlier sessions . The person responsible for the course should take the following actions : 1 ) Aligning the grading criteria with the assignment instructions2 ) Clearing out the backlog of assignments that have not yet been peer reviewed . I estimate that there are 50 - 100 still pending review , many were submitted almost one year ago .</text>

Compared to the first stage where every single week had a new subject , with lots of content this one i feel , just didn ' t cut it .

During lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known ( which is okay ) . However the final project required to utilize a combination of all new learned material on a whole different level of difficulty compared to the preceding quizzes . I did not expect that jump in difficulty and enjoyed the course a lot but the final project just was a struggle .</text>

Also it ' s difficult to check when long code snippets should be pasted as plan text in short text field . Better to use file uploading with required snippet .

		<text>The best course I had on coursera . It is a comprehensive overview of current biotechnological techniquess and their established and potential results . The course keeps a shrewd balance between giving scientific information and looking at the broader more complex implications for society . You might think at times that the professor is not a scientist but a philosopher as well . The course is taught superbly by both professor and assistant , not one extra word , and not one word missing given the choice of topics . I think most of what is taught here should ideally be known by the majority of all people , in order to make more informed and thoughtful choices about life , as well as understanding what will happen in the next decades .</text>

		<text>A course without almost any prerequisite knowledge requirements . While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks . Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow . Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use , but it ' s somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and &quot; code - hiding &quot; . Still , I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next .</text>

		<text>It has a little expensive tuition fee than other courses such as Data Science ( Johns Hopkins ) and Data life ( HarvardX _ edx ) . But I decided this course rather than choosing the others because I felt that it was well organized and quite good supplements . What I like most about this course is instructor . She looks like enthusiastic to give a her idea and wisdom . It attracts me to take this course even though it is expensive relatively . Anyway , I appreciate her for dedicated teaching in advance .</text>

		<text>Perfect introduction class . Dr . Ng is very considerate to use plain language to explain all the concepts , consequently making this class really easy to follow . Despite the fact that I myself have an advanced quantitative background , I still find that there are some abundant of take - aways from this class . Thank you so much for putting this course online and for creating Coursera !</text>

		<text>Quick overview of the Arduino platform . Since I was new to Arduino , it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively . The peer - reviewed grading process is something that can be improved . I think the course should have covered some more concepts in detail that are relevant to IoT devices - for example , interrupts and their usage , detailed discussion of the SPI protocol . Also , more elaborate treatment of how to implement security in communication over internet with Arduino would have been great .</text>

		<text>Most of coursera courses I have taken I am not able to complete , it is easy to drop off , not feel engaged , not able to complete the assignments on time . This course had the perfect balance - it had structure easy to follow weeks schedule and quizes . It provided additional reading and articles if needed to dive deeper . It also was a well rounded course with theory , interviews of experienced people from the industry , videos on practical experiments and summarizes of researches done on the field . I would highly recommend this course to any friend and would look forward to completing more with the same professor in same related topic .</text>

		<text>I would not recommend this course for a beginning programmer , as the concepts Oderski covers are fairly complex and the homework is not simple . However , if you are wanting to learn more about functional programming , love to understand the guts of how programming languages work and process data , and want to diver deeper into recursion , then I would definitely recommend this course . I found it very informative and helpful . I will probably take the course again . And Scala is awesome .</text>

Loved every part of this course . Thanks for such wonderful course . very useful content , great readings , but total lack of peer - to - peer engagement . It ' s like reading a book : nice but not up to industry best practices . Overall , the course is lower quality than the ones before from Gregory Northcraft . Another problem with this specific course is word hunting in quizzes . The ones for case studies are especially tricky .</text>

		<text>Overall this is a really great course . My small criticism : Sometimes I wished for more optional videos containing proofs of the formulas . I often spent all the time watching the videos wondering how we would solve some problem only to be presented with a formula without any explanation where it came from . This is only a small problem because the answer was usually not too hard to find and often even linked in the discussion , but if this information were contained in the course content ( e . g . optional videos assuming some linear algebra background ) , it would be even better .</text>

		<text>I ' ll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing . There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways . The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking . The reason that I ' ve only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework . I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation . I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course .</text>

		<text>I have met part of my goals of taking this program . Thank you Prof . Mathias Finger . I would recommend it to be more data oriented like those case studies with specific examples so that it naturally converges to creating case study for a city at the end of the course as final project rather than optional study . Also , suggest to reduce discussions centred to challenges ( the course has taken too much of time ) and more towards different new services adopted by different cities to capture benefits / impact to the city GDP .</text>

		<text>This course was difficult to follow and the free trials offered seemed forced upon us . Lexalytics isn ' t available for a Mac , so I couldn ' t even use it . I think this portion of the specialization would be much better if it focused more on the value of these tools rather than trying to get us to install them . It might be useful for some ( especially those in B2C or willing to play around with the tech ) , but it was a waste of time for me .

I had every field in the new parcels layer but only got 4 points . I think it was a mistake from the grader . absolutely brilliant ! This course is very well structured and very well presented . It touches upon a rather complex area of research but has masterly conveyed the essential skills and methods in a pace that is a bit challenging but not to a point of intimidating . I have watched each and every lecture video for at least 4 times . It is a very good starting point for anyone interested in FSI .</text>

Inspires teachers how to teach and practice character that can influence students to practice the same wherever they are . I believe too many schools now need to know how to teach character that encourages rather than discourages , that brings the good of students rather than the bad . Will be referring to the materials again and again . Thank you Relay / GSE and Coursera !</text>

		<text>I did like the course , it was informative . However , there didn ' t seem to be enough interaction with the professors themselves , and the grading by peers didn ' t make me feel like I really deserved the grade I got . The quizzes were also really easy , which again , made me feel like I didn ' t deserve the grade . It would be great if we could have at least one short paper graded by the professors themselves with a limit of words so it wouldn ' t take up too much of their time .</text>

		<text>The course was really well presented , taught and clear , and although i would prefer it would have been taught in the newer version of python , it actually helped me to do some research and learn new material . A warm special thanks to Prof . Charles Severance for his logical and laid back approach . I hope that a follow up to some more advanced programming in Python will take place in the future . Many thanks Ricardo Fernandes</text>

		<text>It is a good course for all people who want to know more aobut this resource . In opinion each chapter could be a course in order to make a especialization and , about all , one course dedicated to software ( wasp . . . windpro . . ) would give 5 stars . A good introduction course , i hope it helps me to find a new job .</text>

		<text>The whole curse relies on the automated grading system , which is still a little sloppy . I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions . And also , I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors . This could be provided before or after the course , but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems . Thanks</text>

		<text>I have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course - and one spread over 4 weeks . It is extremely basic , extremely general and extremely high level . It should be compressed to 1 - 2 hours and added as an _ optional prerequisite _ to other courses in this specialization . I personally feel cheated out of my 29 USD . 0 . 1 star .</text>

		<text>Firstly I would like to thank Mrs Barbara Oakley , to have come up with such a brilliant MOOC and more over giving out for free . I won ' t say I was a good student or a bad student , but I was always a frustrated one . Even after getting a Post Graduate degree from one of the prestigious colleges , I remained frustrated and carried this frustration till date . Your course has helped me over come my frustrations in many ways . Even interviews with various field experts has been enriching and helped me realize that even scholars have made their way through practice and perseverance , that they were not naturally gifted ones but they got themselves trained , in particular or multiple areas that they have mastered . Thank you once again for sharing these powerful tools and techniques , which has not only enhanced my learning ability , but helped me with getting my thinking process right .</text>

		<text>People use Python for many purposes : to make games , build web services , to solve business problems , to work with sensors , drivers and robots . Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work . Python is an incredibly efficient language : your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require . Py4inf and Python explained by C . Servance , is a great developing of the foundations in programming ( first two courses ) that will serve you well for the rest of your life , as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you .

		<text>I really enjoyed this course and found that I am feeling more confident with my skills from the previous two . However , as a point of improvement I would suggest making the final module a bit more challenging . Perhaps this was intentional but , although the final module introduces JSON well I don ' t feel as though my skills improved while doing it . Then again , the counter argument could be that it is good practice and repetition before moving on to anything too much harder . . . )</text>

		<text>Not the greatest Python course in the world . Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized , technical issues are common , and the discussion forums do not offer much value , as you cannot discuss your code with your peers , and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful . The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it ' s enough to copy &amp; paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around ! You ' re better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform , as well as on other platforms .

Also the quizzes , exercises and projects are well thought through and help a lot with understanding and learning .

I was inspired to do new things towards a globally sustainable world even in my little corner . It was a previledge to be taught by the very experienced Prof Jeffrey Sachs ! Thank you Coursera !</text>

		<text>A really nice , gentle introduction to the basics of the Python language . I was already familiar with much of it from previous endeavours at learning to code , so managed to get through each week in about an evening ' s work , but it didn ' t ' feel right ' to jump into the second course straight away . The last programming assignment caused a little bit of head scratching , and re - highlighted the need for careful , precise thinking when writing even short pieces of code . I ' ve enjoyed this course and will be back for the Data Structures module soon : )</text>

		<text>I like Amy Bloom , but the lectures don ' t provide the explanations or the processes for creating characters . In the Craft of Plot , Skyhorse gave us the tools we need to develop plot and structure , and even how to start to develop characters . But in this course , the lectures don ' t do that . They seem more philosophical than instructional and all of the lectures go right over my head . Craft of Plot gave me hope , Craft of Character confused me .</text>

		<text>A fantastic fundamental insight into the workings of the different aspects of financial markets ! In contrast to most finance classes , there ' s plenty of history to explain how the current financial markets came to be after previous infrastructure was battered many times by financial crises . In addition , the guest lectures by extremely prominent people in the field ( not to mention that the professor himself is a Nobel Laureate ) really gives this course a rather practical aspect as lecturers explain real difficulties outside of the classroom . The actual ( &amp; more mathematical ) version of this class can also be found on YouTube !</text>

		<text>What a fantastic course ! It covered everything an entrepreneur needs to know in 5 weeks . I learnt the meaning of Venture Captalist , Equity owner , angel investor and so many other terms . Making the business plan was the topmost skill i acquired as that really gives one a clear picture of where one stands now and after 3 years . The videos were very clear and articulated the points very well . I will give this a 10 / 10 .</text>

		<text>Once again , Prof Chaikin has hit the ball out of the park in terms of design ( very hands - on ! ) of lessons and delivery of content . The painstaking attention to detail , intuition about particular pitfalls for new learners ( and more proficient ones too , in fact ) and of course , the self - deprecating humor all contribute to making this actually pretty advanced course a whole lotta fun ! And yes , like any really good teacher , Yakov feels the need to delve into theoretic niceties that most wouldn ' t . My background is that of an enthusiast programmer .

Second , sometimes I can be busy on weekends thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday , however , there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed , thus I am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays . Could I just pass if there ' s no other submission to review ?</text>

		<text>Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them ( e . g . Gibbs sampling ) . After this course , it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment . Still , about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you . it tastes so good that you would like to have much more !</text>

		<text>This course is great . The teachers provide excellent exposition of the problems , the formalization , and the solution concepts of generic agents and types of agents acting simultaneously , sequentially in games with complete and incomplete information . The math required is middle school probability calculation and equations . The formal definitions of games and concepts are more demanding , but a complete understanding of the formal definition is not required to solve the problem sets or the exam . The teachers are good at giving explanations and examples in a natural language to scaffold the understanding of the formal definitions .</text>

		<text>I was a student of Art History and I graduated with a theme focusing on Documentary Photography and Photojournalism , therefore I have read many books about photography and I thought I knew a lot about it . But this course showed me new perspectives and ideas , presented new photographers I have not yet know , and gave me new motivation to work in the field of photography . I also appreciated so much that there were scans of books and articles for us to read in combination with images and video I think the mix of all three is a perfect way to study and should be also practised at Faculties ( and from my experience , it is not always like that ) . Great work , I was really lucky and honoured to be part of the course .</text>

		<text>Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course , which I greatly enjoyed . That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook . In this course there is a lot less video content , and the coding assignments are less interesting . Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed , and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB . If you ' re serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book . The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration , which makes them difficult to review , and unlike the case in the ML course , there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics .</text>

		<text>Excellent course . Would like to see more courses like this regarding machine learning for example - courses not focused on the implementation and tools ( for example I am with strong Java background , have read several AI / ML books , implemented several ML algorithms , including deep learning ( DBNN , SdA , Dropout FFNN ) - but all courses are built around python / octave / R tools which I have no interest right now to learn and it is nearly impossible for me to learn both the implementation tool / language and ML theory in parallel . Therefore I do not search for the course in the specific implementation language , I search for the course that can teach &amp; verify my skills one level higher - and I think the way the examples were done in the quizzes - is the right ( and perfect ) way to do it .

In one of the projects we ' re given a data - set that doesn ' t show straight up what to do with it , even with a clear set of instructions . And this is something common in terms of data analysis that everyone eventually faces with . This isn ' t the kind of difficult in terms of technicality , but still took me a couple of times to complete because of the maturity and independence needed to just &quot; tackle &quot; the data . I highly recommend it .</text>

		<text>Could not get through the first week . Way too much emphasis on BlueJ and Duke University specific libraries . I I already have a decent foundation in coding and took the course with the idea I could get a refresher on Java . If your a beginner there are way better courses out there . This course is all over the place and I could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming .</text>

		<text>This course was very informative and helpful , especially for a beginner ' s course . I wish I would have been exposed to different scenarios of situations people face . For example , dealing with a death , mass shootings , terrorist attacks , more natural disasters like earthquakes or tornados , and even abuse . However , learning the basic terms and how to approach and speak to others was very helpful . Thank you ! ! !</text>

		<text>I like the content of the course . However , there are some remarks I want to share . For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud . I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future . I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all .</text>

		<text>I find Prof . Sedgewicks ' moderately paced lectures very concise and easy to follow . His animated demo of each algorithm clearly demonstrates how the algorithm works . I find the problem sets challenging and fun , and finally finding an optimized solution as very rewarding , especially when I get the bonus scores . While this course uses Java as the programming language , I find the concepts quite easy to apply in other programming languages such as C . Thank you very much course staff for offering this excellent course for free here at Coursera !</text>

		<text>There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters . It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming . Yes , a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot , but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality ! Also , I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there ( documentation , etc . ) could help them . Also , as the students start have to read multiple docs , etc . the time expectations per week should be increased .</text>

		<text>Really a great course ! Covering a lot of details , but the most important point is that this course gives a big picture of different levels of understanding of the brain and minds . From the basic neural circuits to network models of computation , and high level cognitive tasks such as emotion , and the instructor even extended the course a little bit to cover some philosophical implications of brain research . By the way , Idan Segev is REALLY A GOOD INSTRUCTOR ! ! ! Thanks for this great course . Hope there may be something like a extended ( advanced ) version of it later on .</text>

		<text>The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics . But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared . The lectures are not well organized . Some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials . Quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity .</text>

		<text>Clear and useful . More real study cases would have been a plus . As the analyses of failures investments . PFI mechanisms and impacts are not integrated . That ' s is missing .</text>

		<text>I really enjoyed this course , Raj ' s sense of humor kept the course interesting ! I felt the reviews at the end of each module were too repetitive and unnecessary , and Catherine ' s explanation of the exercises too drawn out - they are simple exercises and I don ' t think they required and explanation other than what was there when you actually completed the exercise . Other than that , I feel that I learned quite a lot , and am grateful I took this course : ) Thank you Raj !</text>

		<text>I have watched all the videos provided for this course and I think it ' s very educative , simple and well organized for a better understanding . The only thing I think lacking is example of real conflict situations like those between and within states , those between citizens and their elected governments etc . and conflict resolution skills or approaches used both nationally and internationally to resolve them . Thanks again once more for such a wonderful lesson on conflict resolution , it ' s My pleasure to learn from the online courser classes .</text>

		<text>Introduction is much more than this course is , in my respectful opinion . When I read the information on the specialized program , I thought it was something more compact , more useful in the face of the video game industry . However , this program of courses is rather a paltry touchdown , an insignificant approach . I think it should be underlined that it is a course for those who have never had any experience in videogames development . Considering all this , is a great course . You have to be objective .</text>

		<text>The content was very useful , especially the lessons that focused on applying the scientific method to computer science . I liked the fact that most concepts were taught , and then reviewed again at the end of a video , solidifying what I learned . I did find the quality of the videos to be rather lacking . As someone who develops online courses for a living , I suggest using two cameras so that you can switch between two views when a cut is needed to prevent jumping or leaving mistakes in videos . The professors definitely seemed nervous , but I suppose that goes away with time . Thank you for this awesome course !</text>
