The only drawbacks are that there is so much reading to do ( but you can succeed in the course and only do as much of the reading as you want to ) and the 70 question final exam ( but given that you can take it as many times as you want you can get any grade that you ' re willing to put in the time for ) .####[]

I signed up to audit this course , but ended up enrolling in the specialization because this course is so phenomenal !####[]

I did like the course , it was informative .####[]
However , there didn ' t seem to be enough interaction with the professors themselves , and the grading by peers didn ' t make me feel like I really deserved the grade I got .####[]

It would be great if we could have at least one short paper graded by the professors themselves with a limit of words so it wouldn ' t take up too much of their time .####[]
The course was really well presented , taught and clear , and although i would prefer it would have been taught in the newer version of python , it actually helped me to do some research and learn new material .####[]

Few glitches when it came to grading and assignment instructions .####[]
BUT the discussion board is really helpful and interactive .####[]
The TA ' s also provide timely help .####[]
Many interesting techniques to better learning and memorizing the material you want .####[]
But , IMHO , the concept of chunking isn ' t discovered by 100 % .####[]
Also , I think , that material can be arranged more effectively to understand easier .####[]
Anyway , I am very happy , that I learned how to learn and the information is really helpful to learn .####[]
Thanks !####[]
The course is interesting and the self - reflection activies are great opportunies to learn about yourself .####[]
However , the course is very short .####[]
Each week takes less than 1 hour to watch and it feels like an introduction of an introduction .####[]
If you love to learn a lot about something , I don ' t think this course is for you .####[]
However , if you want to take time to learn about yourself , it ' s great .####[]
This course was great !####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'great']]
It was also my first MOOC !####[]
It cleared up a lot of the things that were blurry before .####[['NULL', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'NULL']]
I especially enjoyed the Security part , which I deal with tangentially at work and I could never quite grasp the concepts , but now I do .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['NULL', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'NULL']]

This is really a good set of tools for law students .####[]
I have finished the first week , and it really helped a lot already .####[]
The videos are not very long , so you can just spend 30 minutes everyday for one or two small videos .####[]
The professor uses formal legal language that may require extra work but if you like the legal reasoning , it ' s such a wonderful exercise !####[]
This course is such a fun and useful one .####[]
The videos are short but sharp enough to let you learn and remember the lectures .####[]
The course can also be very helpful in everyday life no matter what your proficiency is .####[]
The interviews are great .####[]
This course will literally help you with many other courses that you are going to take and it is a fundamental for education , I think .####[]
An informative and interesting course !####[]
Dr . Barbara Oakley and Dr . Terrence Sejnowski have very entertaining and enjoyable approach in teaching practical ideas on learning .####[]
I learned alot and have recommended this course to friends and family .####[]
Thank you !####[]
I really enjoyed this course and found that I am feeling more confident with my skills from the previous two .####[]
However , as a point of improvement I would suggest making the final module a bit more challenging .####[]
Perhaps this was intentional but , although the final module introduces JSON well####[]
I don ' t feel as though my skills improved while doing it .####[]
Then again , the counter argument could be that it is good practice and repetition before moving on to anything too much harder . . . )####[]
I ' ve enjoyed this course greatly , and look forward to delve further into philosophy .####[]
I loved all of the talks by all the lecturers , and found their follow - up videos to be particularly helpful .####[]
Unfortunately , that also meant that there was no forum to access and discuss the questions posed by the lectures with other people taking the course , which I believe would have helped to hone my argumentative skills , which I believe is necessary to have ( and further develop and enhance ) , when learning about philosophy .####[]
Thank you very much for this amazing course .####[]
If you could introduce more philosophy courses ( particularly ones that are more advanced and in depth ) , that would be great !####[]
Great Course for angular 1 . x for angular newbies .####[]
It includes almost all the angular basic concept , including module , controller , service , filter , directive , view , data model , expressions , two way binding , dependency injection .####[]
And also this course provides a good full example illustrating how to use angular CRUD app .####[]
However , finishing this course is far from being proficient in angular developing , you should keep practicing more and find more resources from angular official websites .####[]
Wonderfull course .####[]
I highly recomend it .####[]
All the professors and people invited to share experiences are very well prepared , they speak in a way that it easy to understand .####[]
I learned a lot and realized that as a general doctor from another country still need so much to learn about just the basics of this epidemy .####[]
I loved it .####[]
A very good and interesting course .####[]
The videos are concise and to the point .####[]
Some of the assignments are somewhat challenging , so you shouldn’t be afraid of high school math or doing calculations and plots with Excel .####[]
I really liked this course and I’ve learned a lot .####[]
A must in a world more and more complexe , but where science says everything is connected , and good interactions can make the whole system evolve .####[]
Edgar Morin makes it easy , I loved weeks 2 and 5 , and####[]
I ' m finishing 3 and 6 , it goes from general paradigm of complexity , to knowledge , companies , futur of civilisation , globalisationn etc etc Looking forward to courses covering applications of the system in different fields : permaculture , blue economy , integral theory etc etc oh yeaah Intergal theory .####[]
Thank you : )####[]
Very interesting , but I was really hoping more .####[]
For example , the professor does not teah us directly , like all the other courses on Coursera .####[]
It is only texts and archive videos .####[]
Youtube would have done the same .####[]
Disappointed .####[]
This is an amazing course .####[]
I´m really happy .####[]
I had a really good time with the bibliography , the topics , and the teacher .####[]
¡THAKS####[]
A LOT !####[]
I still only partially through this course but I am very impressed .####[]
The professor is excellent ; he brings humor into the lessons and explains everything in a way that we can understand .####[]
I also love the fact that he interviews various experts throughout the course in order to bring in even more perspectives .####[]
This class is extremely interesting to me and beyond my expectations .####[]
Thanks to the professor and to Coursera !####[]
As an introduction before starting Finance modules is perfect .####[]
History of finance , main concepts , useful info , short but informative .####[]
More related to US economy , but Prof . Schiller ' s examples helps a lot .####[]
If you want to understand better of learn more , need to download whole lectures from Yale for this course ( 23 of them available online ) .####[]
Good luck to everyone ! ! !####[]
I love the professors , but unfortunately , I do not feel much connection to me ( not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements ; I am not an investor , and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements ) .####[['professors', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'love'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'negative', 'do not feel much connection']]
The Managerial Accounting ( week 4 ) transforms my mindset ! !####[['Managerial Accounting', 'course general', 'positive', 'transforms my mindset']]

Just superb .####[]
Is there a better , more passionate and lucid guide to this extraordinary music than Jonathan Biss ?####[]
The whole series is utterly compelling .####[]
It ' s made me listen to and absorb the sonatas in a whole new way , and it ' s opened my eyes to the full scope and scale , beauty and humour of Beethoven ' s genius in a way I ' d never imagined possible .####[]
Can ' t wait for more new lectures in the future .####[]
I thoroughly enjoyed the course .####[]
I was disappointed that there was not more participation in the forums from other classmates .####[]
I found Dr . Oakley ' s methods of teaching very creative and assisting in the learning process .####[]
The testing did indeed help my learning as it showed where I was wrong and gave me the opportunity to correct it .####[]
The outside reading was also helpful in understanding the material .####[]
This was a good course .####[]
The most valuable parts were the practical tips : using the Chrome developer tools , showing console . log ( ) , etc .####[]
The first two assignments were challenging and fun .####[]
The last two on javascript were a bit less useful , but overall a very good course .####[]
Had a blast doing this course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Had a blast']]

Not as good as the Regression Course , but still very good .####[]
While I appreciate prof Guestrin ' s enthusiasm , I missed a little rigor and mathematical depth of the Regression ' s course by Prof . Fox .####[]
I learned a lot , but I feel that regression clicked with me a little better than classification .####[]
But that ' s probably me .####[]
In either case , the whole series are awesome so far , better , in my opinion , than Anrdrew Ng ' s ML course on coursera , A small suggestion would be to switch the main toolset from the Graphlab to something more common , like Sci - kit learn and Pandas .####[]
This course provides a well - paced introduction to learning the Korean language .####[]
It is well - suited to students who have little or no knowledge of Korean language to begin with .####[]
The course videos and the conversations of the players in the instructive videos helps us to get a feel for how the language operates in a real situation .####[]
The course lecturer provides detailed explanations of the origins of Korean vowels and consonants , the way the language is constructed , correct pronunciation , and much more .####[]
I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the Korean language .####[]
Many thanks to our lecturer for this great course .####[]
As the second course in the specialization , I continue to find the material covered to be useful and fairly easy to learn .####[]
Between the first and second course , I feel like both courses were able to lay and build upon a foundation of knowledge with each chapter covered .####[]
I did find the second course to be a little more difficult , but one would expect this with the addition of more code learned .####[]
However , I still felt like the graded exercises weren ' t too difficult to complete as a beginner to Python .####[]
Can ' t wait to enroll in the next course !####[]
Not the greatest Python course in the world .####[]
Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized , technical issues are common , and the discussion forums do not offer much value , as you cannot discuss your code with your peers , and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful .####[]
The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it ' s enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around !####[]
You ' re better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform , as well as on other platforms .####[]
The only thing I liked about the course were the interviews with people behind Python , but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging .####[]
Excellent course for learning the very basics of Python .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Excellent']]
The class was well organized and easy to understand .####[['class', 'course quality', 'positive', 'well organized'], ['class', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'easy to understand']]
I liked the exercises .####[['exercises', 'assignments quality', 'positive', 'liked']]
They were a bit challenging in the end .####[['NULL', 'assignments quality', 'positive', 'bit challenging']]
My only negative thing to say is that I hope they are able to update the time it takes to grade assignments on the server .####[['grade assignments', 'grades general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
I can ' t wait to take the next course !####[]
The course was very simplistic and more targeted to a new manager or a student who has never taken a conflict resolution course .####[]
I only found the interviews with Karen and Joseph to be of interest .####[]
The instructor ' s teaching style is too monotone####[]
I didn ' t get a sense of her real world experience coming through .####[]
No sense of her brand .####[]
Matt , is awesome .####[]
Exercises are helpful so you can get the basics of what you need to learn .####[]
Also , complementary lectures and videos for advanced students are very helpful .####[]
I think there should be a follow up course to get an understanding on current research .####[]
So exciting !####[]
I definitely Recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about the basics of web design , HTML5 , and coding .####[]
The way this course is setup is perfect for beginners with its extremely helpful and insightful readings along with the course lecture video s .####[]
The professor has really done an amazing job of teaching and engaging students through the videos while also giving helpful resources and tips for students to venture on their own and investigate the topics further .####[]
I highly recommend to follow along , especially with the coding , when the professor suggest it .####[]
It will really help out in the long run and help you become familiar with the process .####[]
Excellent , its soo good to be able to do this course on - line .####[]
As a professional , I feel this course has enlightened me to better serve our communities in the event of a disaster or any kind of trauma .####[]
I never want to be unprepared in case someone is in trouble .####[]
TAKE THE COURSE .####[]
IT IS EXCELLENT .####[]
Many thanks for this course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
I would love it .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'love']]

After 3 great courses in this specialization , this one was disappointing .####[]
The content just isn ' t explained well in the videos .####[]
The Labs were fine .####[]
I ' m sorry but the course seemed rushed , and it isn ' t great marketing for the Bayesian approach .####[]
As a consequence , I am now not sure if I want to do the capstone .####[]
Totally Awesome !####[]
The best part is reviewing peers and being reviewed .####[]
Lots to learn just by evaluating speeches from all around the world .####[]
Keep it up Matt Sir .####[]
Looking forward to the other 3 courses of Public Speaking .####[]
Wonderful class .####[]
I have taken many finance classes in the past .####[]
So while I knew most of the topics covered , I learned a lot about the history behind the principles and one ' s moral obligation in finance . very fun teacher .####[]
Great for all levels .####[]
Basically if you take this course you are paying money to create an account on a website and download some software ( both of which you can do for free ) .####[]
The rest of it is a preview of the other courses in the series .####[]
The quiz questions don ' t correspond to the information on the slides .####[]
I successfully passed the course , but####[]
I didn ' t really learn anything .####[]
Now I am debating on whether or not to continue to the R programming course after reading through the reviews of that course .####[]
This course is a great one .####[]
My first Coursera course !####[]
It covered enough ground which I ' d wish should be there in any online course , because too much of details may make online learning experience boring and too less of it means you haven ' t learned much .####[]
Whereas the amount of material covered in this course was having right balance .####[]
I ' d recommend this course to every wanna be web - developer !####[]
Such a great course !####[]
I ' ve used BeautifulSoup an JSON a lot while scraping the web and this was a nice foundation refresher .####[]
It also taught me coding conventions and####[]
I didn ' t realize I needed !####[]
Like properly encoding URL parameters to APIs####[]
Learned so much .####[]
Great course - good mix of video instruction , mini quizzes & questions , graded quizzes etc . to keep your attention .####[]
Also , the information is current and practical .####[]
Definitely recommend .####[]
The syllabus is adequate , suitable for introducing digital marketing .####[]
Videos are all right , with a good selection of interviewed professionals .####[]
Transcripts are very useful to have under the videos , however , there are mistyped and misheard words here and there .####[]
It is useful to see the time needed for each task ( video , reading , excercise ) , though it is nearly always underestimated ( even the videos ) .####[]
Examples chosen for excercises are interesting and motivating .####[]
I like this active way of learning .####[]
All three parts ( html css and javascript ) covered by this course are well taught .####[]
It is targets beginners very well .####[]
I especially like the way how javascript is introduced - - in contrast to normal programming language courses which start with grammar , here it starts with examples .####[]
This way one can very fast already start programming something , which is much more interesting .####[]
Also the quizzes , exercises and projects are well thought through and help a lot with understanding and learning .####[]
Finally , about the examples used in this course , many of them are simple and nice , but some of them are maybe too simple to convey the message , such that it doesn ' t help much with understanding . . .####[]
Great course but the main problem is that very little help is available .####[]
Programming assignment is not able to understand meaning not able to find how to start ( what should be the first step ? ) pace is little fast . learned a lot about Cloud Computing .####[]
Homeworks are really challenging .####[]
Very informative .####[]
Tedious concepts like ANOVA , Chi square test etc taught in very simple and effective manner .####[]
There ' re two options for analysis , SAS and Phython .####[]
I ' d recommend readers to read more on PROC ANOVA for better understanding .####[]
This is a great opportunity to learn some excellent skills in a language that is powerful yet easy enough to learn the basics .####[]
I enjoyed every moment of this class .####[]
I learned a lot about python and Charles Severance ( Dr . Chuck ) provides an excellent learning experience why presenting the material in a concise , structured and fun manner .####[]
I ' m pursuing all 5 ( even the capstone course ) courses to earn the specialization in an up and coming language I feel we will see more apps being developed in the Python Language .####[]
Thanks Doctor Chuck and the University of Michigan !####[]
This course was very informative and delivered in a comprehensible manner .####[]
The topics were well designed and flowed in a sequence that helped the learner add on the knowledge as they progressed .####[]
I was inspired to do new things towards a globally sustainable world even in my little corner .####[]
It was a previledge to be taught by the very experienced Prof Jeffrey Sachs !####[]
Thank you Coursera !####[]
A really nice , gentle introduction to the basics of the Python language .####[]
I was already familiar with much of it from previous endeavours at learning to code , so managed to get through each week in about an evening ' s work , but it didn ' t ' feel right ' to jump into the second course straight away .####[]
The last programming assignment caused a little bit of head scratching , and re - highlighted the need for careful , precise thinking when writing even short pieces of code .####[]
I ' ve enjoyed this course and will be back for the Data Structures module soon : )####[]
I like Amy Bloom , but the lectures don ' t provide the explanations or the processes for creating characters .####[]
In the Craft of Plot , Skyhorse gave us the tools we need to develop plot and structure , and even how to start to develop characters .####[]
But in this course , the lectures don ' t do that .####[]
They seem more philosophical than instructional and all of the lectures go right over my head .####[]
Craft of Plot gave me hope , Craft of Character confused me .####[]
Comprehensive .####[]
Challenging .####[]
Encouraging .####[]
I am very thankful####[]
I took and completed this course ( even if it took me a couple attempts ! ) .####[]
Thank you Coursera , Prof Ng and of course Mentors ; more power to you !####[]
I cant believe that i just made a simple program by myself####[]
Dr Chunk is Great ! and of course a big thanks to The Coursera platform which opened a way for us to learn mostly for the people like me who has willing to learn but cant afford the course fees .####[]
I have no more words to express .####[]
Thanks####[]
A fantastic fundamental insight into the workings of the different aspects of financial markets !####[]
In contrast to most finance classes , there ' s plenty of history to explain how the current financial markets came to be after previous infrastructure was battered many times by financial crises .####[]
In addition , the guest lectures by extremely prominent people in the field ( not to mention that the professor himself is a Nobel Laureate ) really gives this course a rather practical aspect as lecturers explain real difficulties outside of the classroom .####[]
The actual ( & more mathematical ) version of this class can also be found on YouTube !####[]
This was a very informative course .####[]
It help me realize that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to improve interoperability between EHRs as well as improving communication with the patients and families as well as communication between providers .####[]
This will most certainly help me in the work that I ' m involved in right now which is family centered care .####[]
We already invite the parents to participate in morning rounds with all the team members .####[]
The lecture about trust was loaded with helpful information .####[]
Great work ! !####[]
What a fantastic course !####[]
It covered everything an entrepreneur needs to know in 5 weeks .####[]
I learnt the meaning of Venture Captalist , Equity owner , angel investor and so many other terms .####[]
Making the business plan was the topmost skill i acquired as that really gives one a clear picture of where one stands now and after 3 years .####[]
The videos were very clear and articulated the points very well .####[]
I will give this a 10 / 10 .####[]
This course gave me a lot of food for thought .####[]
I ' ll be to ponder a long time about what i had learned .####[]
I can already see how I can improve my learning process .####[]
Thank you very mutch !####[]
И будьте здоровы !####[]
Excellent overview of the global financial crisis !####[]
Prof . Metrick does a great job dissecting the complex financial system to help understand the crisis .####[]
The modules are well organized and engaging .####[]
Really gave me an appreciation for economic policy and financial markets .####[]
I ' ve given this course five stars because I ' ve conformed to the masses and was told to rate with five stars .####[]
Nah !####[]
Seriously though , I would recommend this course to anybody .####[]
It is brilliant and Steve Joordens explains things amazingly , the best way that somebody who is 6 ' 3 " tall can do !####[]
Fantastic course .####[]
Hope there ' s a follow - up / advanced course as I ' d be more than interested .####[]
Lectures and other material just don ' t cover the information needed in the course project .####[]
Majority of the learning has to be done outside of this course , in order to pass the course project .####[]
I cannot recommend this course anyone who is not deeply familiar with the topic already .####[]
The course project is truly frustrating !####[]
I thought the course presented a nice overview of the concepts .####[]
I would need lots of additional in - depth instruction before I could successfully apply the concepts .####[]
I struggled with the programming exercises .####[]
I am not a professional programmer and the course was my first use of Octave .####[]
But I am glad I took the course and I am ready for more .####[]
Definitely recommended .####[]
I have no prior coding or programming knowledge but the course is effective in making one understand the language .####[]
Would look forward to the 2nd course .####[]
Thank you : )####[]
I really enjoyed course 1 , it was easy to understand and follow !####[]
I only wish that I could get my papers scored faster so it shows as complete .####[]
. . still I can work at my own pace ( fast ) and earn my certificate so I can get to the good stuff . working as a teacher !####[]
This is very good course for beginners to understand the basic knowledge about Machine Learning .####[]
Very Good !####[]
I would like to hear some other courses from Dr . Andrew Wu if it is also available on Coursera .####[]
The neo4j parts were good , and nice introduction to graph terminology and concepts . would like to see detailed hands - on for wk # 5 like wk # 4 had w / neo4j , which was very well done ) . like the tools survey and concepts . would like to see recommendations for other course ( s ) , not necessarily in this series or by UC SanDiego , about where to go for deeper math .####[]
Before taking this course , I ' ve never tried any coding and I don ' t even know if I ' ll be able to continue this .####[]
However , the teaching style of Charles Severance is fun and interesting , I do like and enjoy the new field and learn a lot from the course .####[]
Good job !####[]
Mr . Severance !####[]
A great course !####[]
Mostly I joined this course as a re - cap since it was####[]
15 years ago I took my examination .####[]
In applied math ' s ( algebra , optimization , . . . ) together with computer science ( AI , machine learning , . . . ) ) .####[]
I really enjoyed watching Andrew Ng videos and doing the Quiz ' s and programming exercises .####[]
Now I hope to realize some of this cool stuff : - ) / / Peter####[]
Personally felt this course have a lot more potential .####[]
The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts .####[]
At times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them .####[]
A lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations .####[]
I have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the concepts .####[]
Good thing is that this is an introductory course , and the codes are given .####[]

Words . . .####[]
TOO MANY Words ! !####[]
Talking talking talking , most if it without valuable content .####[]
I got bored listening to the instructors continuously telling us what they were going to tell us , repeating themselves , and then telling us what they told us again and again and again .####[]
Also WAY too many UMMMMsss from the instructors .####[]
I ' m really enjoying the course .####[]
It gets difficult sometimes since I have no IT background .####[]
But there ' s nothing that can ' t be figured out .####[]
Of course one needs to apply additional efforts for a deeper dive to the subject .####[]
Overall it ' s a great basic course to start with .####[]
The course content is perfect , however the rating system is kind of disappointing .####[]
First , the rating is very subjective , thus I might pay great efforts to my submission but get a grade below my expectation .####[]
Second , sometimes I can be busy on weekends thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday , however , there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed , thus I am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays .####[]
Could I just pass if there ' s no other submission to review ?####[]
Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them ( e . g .####[]
Gibbs sampling ) .####[]
After this course , it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment .####[]
Still , about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you . it tastes so good that you would like to have much more !####[]
Not a lot of interaction with other classmates .####[]
The material was a good refresher .####[]
Would have enjoyed more practical applications for homework .####[]
I thought there would be a bit more evidence based information as stated .####[]
Overall , good for newbies into management and a nice little refresher .####[]
Well laid out and illustrated .####[]
I used this as a review of basic statistic concepts .####[]
Really enjoyed the course !####[]
Thanks !####[]
Honey H .####[]
This course is great .####[]
The teachers provide excellent exposition of the problems , the formalization , and the solution concepts of generic agents and types of agents acting simultaneously , sequentially in games with complete and incomplete information .####[]
The math required is middle school probability calculation and equations .####[]
The formal definitions of games and concepts are more demanding , but a complete understanding of the formal definition is not required to solve the problem sets or the exam .####[]
The teachers are good at giving explanations and examples in a natural language to scaffold the understanding of the formal definitions .####[]
Amazing Course , teaches you right from basics .####[]
Prof . Ng explains everything in a manner which makes it easy to understand .####[]
Only one shortcoming I found in this course is , not challenging enough programming exercises .####[]
I understand that course has to cater a general and large crowd , but adding maybe a few optional challenging exercises might help .####[]
Also , if optional video content is provided for algorithms which have been taught in CS229 but are absent here , it will be really useful .####[]
Fun .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'Fun']]
Challenging with gamification .####[['NULL', 'course quality', 'positive', 'Challenging']]
Maybe it ' s a little short .####[['NULL', 'course quality', 'negative', 'little short']]
I was expecting to put in a lot of work in this capstone maybe because I was expecting a more thorough , longer analysis challenge .####[]
So a recommendation is : In the same style , create more weeks where the challenges will increase .####[]
I was a student of Art History and I graduated with a theme focusing on Documentary Photography and Photojournalism , therefore I have read many books about photography and I thought I knew a lot about it .####[]
But this course showed me new perspectives and ideas , presented new photographers I have not yet know , and gave me new motivation to work in the field of photography .####[]
I also appreciated so much that there were scans of books and articles for us to read in combination with images and video####[]
I think the mix of all three is a perfect way to study and should be also practised at Faculties ( and from my experience , it is not always like that ) .####[]
Great work , I was really lucky and honoured to be part of the course .####[]
Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course , which I greatly enjoyed .####[]
That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook .####[]
In this course there is a lot less video content , and the coding assignments are less interesting .####[]
Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed , and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB .####[]
If you ' re serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book .####[]
The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration , which makes them difficult to review , and unlike the case in the ML course , there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics .####[]
It was a good course , however , it seems that the recording was from the earlier course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'good'], ['recording', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
Which I don ' t mind , however , some of the comment wasn ' t relevant , so it was a bit weird .####[['NULL', 'presentation relatability', 'negative', "wasn ' t relevant"]]
In terms of content and how the course run , it was beyond my expectation .####[['content', 'material quality', 'positive', 'beyond my expectation'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'beyond my expectation']]
The list of literature provided were quite extesive and strategicaly chosen .####[['list of literature', 'material quantity', 'positive', 'quite extesive'], ['list of literature', 'material quality', 'positive', 'strategicaly chosen']]
I wish there ' s a whole syllabus that we can access in the beginning of the course to prepare for the assignment .####[['syllabus', 'material quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
This course is less demanding than I expected / hoped , but nevertheless the content and its delivery was top - notch .####[]
The lectures present material in a clear and natural way .####[]
Course content is immediately and easily applied to daily life .####[]
The video production is the among the best I ' ve seen in online education .####[]
Not groundbreaking , but immensely helpful to those unfamiliar with this material .####[]
Definitely worth your time .####[]
Colleen van Lent is really great , the course is well put together , and the video quality was excellent ( looking at other courses , I now see that this is not always the case ) .####[]
I went through the HTML5 and CSS3 course and found them to be well - structured and thorough .####[]
There was a lot of opportunity to put into practice the skills we were learning and lots of helpful resources to point students in the right direction for additional help .####[]
I didn ' t like peer reviewing at first , but it was actually a useful exercise .####[]
I realized that other people may come at a problem in a slightly different way , and looking at their code helped me gain some insight into that nuance .####[]
Thanks , Colleen !####[]
Terrific instructor .####[]
Cover difficult topics well and in a very fine progression with very good transitions .####[]
Good explanations and good examples of concepts .####[]
Workable , useful knowledge gained .####[]
A very fine professor with a clear interest in teaching students .####[]
Great Course !####[]
I loved the first module of Marketing in a Digital World .####[]
Professor Aric Rindfleisch is excellent .####[]
The material and exercises give full comprehension of the subject even for the ones without Marketing background .####[]
I would recommend it .####[]
Very useful course for beginners who want to start learning embedded systems .####[]
This intro course to arduino is ' THE ' place to start your embedded learning .####[]
Professor Harris is great , he explained everything in detail , maintained the clarity while explaining the concepts and kept it simple , just introduced to what we need to know to get started .####[]
Thanks to Dr . Harris and UC Irvine for offering such a great course for free , it was really useful for me .####[]
I highly recommend this course for beginners .####[]
I learned so much from this course !####[]
It was amazing how Dr . Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses , such as evaluation strategy , functional collections , reactive programming , and associativity , to describe the core of Spark in only four units .####[]
As someone coming from more of a statistics background , I started this specialization only to learn Spark , so####[]
I wasn ' t always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be .####[]
It turns out that it was pretty essential , while also just making me a better programmer .####[]
Looking forward to the capstone !####[]
This is probably the best course that I have done in my life .####[]
This is an essential for any one in the world of today .####[]
The course is going to be taken by my children .####[]
Prof Barbara O was phenomenal , an example of person walking the walk and talking the talk .####[]
This was easily the most valuable course done in my life and needs to be done by every body .####[]
Most pleased with way the course was run - - and the demonstrable value I got from it .####[]
I started this course not knowing what I ' ll be getting , not knowing if it will succeed in improving the way I learn and my life overall .####[]
Now , that uncertainty cleared out and I know for sure that this course did it for me .####[]
Now####[]
I ' m learning new things everyday and actually getting values out of them .####[]
The course covered the material that was on the HSK 2 final exam .####[]
I successfully completed the final examination on one try .####[]
So , the course fulfilled its part .####[]
It did get a bit more difficult in the final few weeks .####[]
Professor did a great job .####[]
I have taken the non - certification course of Machine Leaning by Dr . Andrew Ng .####[]
The material covered is this course is adequate and very insightful .####[['material', 'material quantity', 'positive', 'adequate'], ['material', 'material quality', 'positive', 'very insightful']]
In my opinion this course should be a start point for any individual who want to learn Machine Learning .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
This course provides all the necessary fundamentals with a little bit of math that gives an intuitive sense of the algorithms .####[['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'necessary fundamentals'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'intuitive sense of the algorithms']]
I would gladly recommend this course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'gladly recommend']]
Had so much fun while learning .####[]
Thanks to Dr . Wayne Whiteman for being such a generous teacher .####[]
Best Regards - S .####[]

Although I have got over ten years of practical experience in both placing implants and restoring teeth on implants , I was very pleasantly surprised by the multitude and quality of new knowledge and practical tips I have received from this course .####[]
I would like to thank professor Matteos and the team for making possible this superb and brilliant course , which will remain a cornerstone implantology reference for me in the years to come .####[]
With best wishes and deepest respect , Predrag Škrinjar , dr . dent . med .####[]
Ljubljana , Slovenia ) , MSc AGDP ( Birminham , UK )####[]
Very very helpful .####[]
Everyone should take this course !####[]
We often work very hard on subjects but we lack the technique to learn something new so we tend to leave it imcomplete or complete it with not much satisfaction .####[]
This course teaches us how to utilize every single minute of your hard work and that too in a positive sense .####[]
I found this course very helpful and interesting .####[]
Ma ' am Colleen van lent made this course very easy for us .####[]
Teaching , learning and step by step advancing everything is handled perfectly .####[]
I always found HTML a little bit fuzzy but after this course I know the core of html .####[]
I would prefer every novice or new - ones to start html from this course .####[]
I felt it was too basic .####[]
It took me about a week , but if I ' d had the time I could have done it all in a day .####[]
Hope the rest of the specialization is more in - depth . .####[]
Also there are no forums . makes it impossible to interact when you have questions .####[]
Well done .####[]
Excellent quizzes and reading and recordings .####[]
There were some sound quality issues .####[]
NOt all recordings were of same quality . .####[]
SOme , esp in first few videos were hard to hear and had some noi####[]
the lessons are well arranged and easy to understand . the tutors are well conversed with the topics being taught and appear to be excited about imparting the knowledge . it has been my pleasure to be part of this MOOC and am well equipped to handle my money matters considering am a medical doctor by profession so this course has been an excellent eye opener to me . keep up the good work and i look forward to more from you ! !####[]
Excellent course !####[]
My only " complaint " really is that I wish the instructors would use other tools besides GraphLab .####[]
I realize that this does make it a lot easier , but####[]
I ' m sure many of us work in environments where we cannot use GraphLab ( for a variety of reasons ) and it would be most helpful it they demonstrated how to accomplish the same thing solely using open source alternatives .####[]
Overall , a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks .####[]
However , I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes .####[]
Some of the quiz items were " off - syllabus " too , although this encouraged further reading .####[]
I enjoyed the programming exercises , particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines , and would have liked more of them .####[]
For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng ' s course first .####[]
Excellent course .####[]
Would like to see more courses like this regarding machine learning for example - courses not focused on the implementation and tools ( for example I am with strong Java background , have read several AI / ML books , implemented several ML algorithms , including deep learning ( DBNN , SdA , Dropout FFNN ) - but all courses are built around python / octave / R tools which I have no interest right now to learn and it is nearly impossible for me to learn both the implementation tool / language and ML theory in parallel .####[]
Therefore I do not search for the course in the specific implementation language , I search for the course that can teach & verify my skills one level higher - and I think the way the examples were done in the quizzes - is the right ( and perfect ) way to do it .####[]
Hth .####[]
Tomas####[]
A very good starter on Machine Learning .####[]
Very well taught !####[]
Awesome videos , practical use cases and intriguing programming exercises .####[]
Highly recommend for anyone looking to step into a future in ML .####[]
Had great fun completing this course .####[]
The narration and content are excellent .####[]
The clarity of the slides has given neat direction steps to installing the software .####[]
However , I was not able to co relate the Command Line Interface with the R console after installation .####[]
I was overwhelmed with the huge list of commands immediately after software installation .####[]
The Week 3 videos have great information but lacks a coherence with the remaining course content .####[]
very detailed and accessible presentation of educational material , excellent examples and exercises .####[]
A lot of excellent educational material for additional saomstoyatelnogo study .####[]
Homework creative and complex .####[]
For that thank you very much .####[]
I would like to have another very large rate of in - depth study of javascript####[]
The course was very useful in introducing me to the basic concepts of modelling .####[]
I am now familiar with the necessary vocabulary to participate in conversations about modelling .####[]
It also refreshed my intuition on the basic mathematical functions .####[]
Most interesting part was the steps I have to follow when I want to construct a particular model in order to help me in answering questions about a business process .####[]
I also found out that this is a continuous process and usually I might not construct good one from the first time .####[]
I am looking forward to the next stages and so far I would definitely recommend it to my friends !####[]
This course changed my perspective about the process of learning .####[]
It gave me a deep understanding of how my brain works .####[]
It also provided important facts about memory and significant techniques such as the pomodoro and memory palace .####[]
Dr Oakely gave some really helpful tips to help overcome your stress during tests and showed how to make the best use of your neural system .####[]
I ' m really happy that I learned how to learn : )####[]
This course could ' ve been better by the inclusion of more examples , the lecturer is very monotonous and sadly i see no discussion forum for this course , in addition to that , whenever i tried replying to the comments the reply button turned grey and nothing happened .####[['course', 'course general', 'negative', "could ' ve been better"], ['lecturer', 'faculty general', 'negative', 'very monotonous'], ['NULL', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'no discussion forum']]
I had reported to resolve the issue but nothing happened the issue persists .####[]
It could have been done much better specially the lectures .####[['lectures', 'course general', 'positive', 'could have been done much better']]
Thank you : )####[]
This is a wonderful course .####[]
This course brings you from basic information about brain to quite novel research approaches and topics regarding the human ( or generally mammal ) brain .####[]
This all is done in very understandable way .####[]
I ' m looking forward to see more courses from Hebrew University and specifically from Idan Segev .####[]
Thank You .####[]
Such an impressive professor .####[]
I love his way of teaching .####[]
Full of sense of humor .####[]
Class is full of fun .####[]
I can ' t wait to finish all the requirement of this course and to get enrolled in the next one !####[]
Very good course , not many available online courses on this subject .####[]
Warning :####[]
Course is very fast paced ( and the instructors give only broad hints as they move from 1 step to the next and it is left to us to figure out stuff - which is how it should be of course ) .####[]
Therefore expect to be kept busy throughout the course .####[]
I barely had any previous knowledge on the subject , so folks with some basic understanding of the subject may have a different view####[]
Its been a good learning .####[]
The narration was to the point and the course content was thorough for the scope envisaged .####[]
Enjoyed it .####[]
More importantly it forces you to think ! . so it ' s kind of interactive .####[]
Thank you very much .####[]
This is a great course for new parents who have no background on child nutrition .####[]
For those who are already familiar with basic nutrition , most of this course may be a review for you but there ' s some good information and facts to take away .####[]
I wish the instructor had a little more training / skill in the cooking segments ( e . g . basic knife skills she said don ' t cut your finger but held the knife completely wrong , using the knife to point at different ingredients ) .####[]
This course was very helpful to understand the in depth Machine learning algorithm .####[]
This was designed very simple and very effective .####[]
I liked all the examples & Lecture notes .####[]
Time to to time I can revisit and clarify all my doubts .####[]
Overall its a excellent course .####[]
I would recommend this course for everyone who wanted to excel their career in Data Science .####[]
I am super confident even with just two weeks into the course of coming out as a really skilled developer , and hopefully have a fairly advanced " developer ' s intuition " .####[]
Best part is he has worked diligently on the minutest of details and been careful how on - line learning can be difficult .####[]
I have never done coding , and have often wondered what could be special to it .####[]
So . . guess the course approaches a specialisation successfully allowing retention of that " excitement & curiosity " that almost always is inherent to learning .####[]
Five stars already .####[]
This course presented a very useful challenge in terms of data analysis .####[]
In one of the projects we ' re given a data - set that doesn ' t show straight up what to do with it , even with a clear set of instructions .####[]
And this is something common in terms of data analysis that everyone eventually faces with .####[]
This isn ' t the kind of difficult in terms of technicality , but still took me a couple of times to complete because of the maturity and independence needed to just " tackle " the data .####[]
I highly recommend it .####[]
Could not get through the first week .####[]
Way too much emphasis on BlueJ and Duke University specific libraries .####[]
I I already have a decent foundation in coding and took the course with the idea####[]
I could get a refresher on Java .####[]
If your a beginner there are way better courses out there .####[]
This course is all over the place and I could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming .####[]
This course was very informative and helpful , especially for a beginner ' s course .####[]
I wish I would have been exposed to different scenarios of situations people face .####[]
For example , dealing with a death , mass shootings , terrorist attacks , more natural disasters like earthquakes or tornados , and even abuse .####[]
However , learning the basic terms and how to approach and speak to others was very helpful .####[]
Thank you ! ! !####[]
I like the content of the course .####[['content of the course', 'material quality', 'positive', 'like']]
However , there are some remarks I want to share .####[]
For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud .####[]
I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all .####[]
Great course .####[]
Very very good instructor .####[]
I have learnt a lot not just about Learning how to learn but also about how the human mind works etc .####[]
Everyone should take it .####[]
It ' s easy and fun .####[]
I find Prof . Sedgewicks ' moderately paced lectures very concise and easy to follow .####[]
His animated demo of each algorithm clearly demonstrates how the algorithm works .####[]
I find the problem sets challenging and fun , and finally finding an optimized solution as very rewarding , especially when I get the bonus scores .####[]
While this course uses Java as the programming language , I find the concepts quite easy to apply in other programming languages such as C .####[]
Thank you very much course staff for offering this excellent course for free here at Coursera !####[]
There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters .####[['libraries', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'so many'], ['libraries', 'material quality', 'positive', 'new'], ['concepts', 'material quality', 'positive', 'new'], ['concepts', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'so many']]
It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming .####[['NULL', 'material comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'little bit confusing'], ['NULL', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'overwhelming']]
Yes , a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot , but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality !####[['fundamental theories', 'material comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'would be great to understand'], ['NULL', 'course relatability', 'negative', 'NULL']]
Also , I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there ( documentation , etc . ) could help them .####[['NULL', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'being overwhelmed']]
Also , as the students start have to read multiple docs , etc . the time expectations per week should be increased .####[['docs', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'read multiple'], ['NULL', 'course workload', 'negative', 'NULL']]
Really a great course !####[]
Covering a lot of details , but the most important point is that this course gives a big picture of different levels of understanding of the brain and minds .####[]
From the basic neural circuits to network models of computation , and high level cognitive tasks such as emotion , and the instructor even extended the course a little bit to cover some philosophical implications of brain research .####[]
By the way , Idan Segev is REALLY A GOOD INSTRUCTOR ! ! !####[]
Thanks for this great course .####[]
Hope there may be something like a extended ( advanced ) version of it later on .####[]
This is the first MOOC that I have completed .####[]
It gave me a brief insight of how games are made .####[]
The instructor is superb .####[]
I ' ll recommend this course .####[]
Thanks , coursera and MSU .####[]
The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics .####[]
But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared .####[]
The lectures are not well organized .####[]
Some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials .####[]
Quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity .####[]
Clear and useful .####[]
More real study cases would have been a plus .####[]
As the analyses of failures investments .####[]
PFI mechanisms and impacts are not integrated .####[]
That ' s is missing .####[]
I really enjoyed this course , Raj ' s sense of humor kept the course interesting !####[]
I felt the reviews at the end of each module were too repetitive and unnecessary , and Catherine ' s explanation of the exercises too drawn out - they are simple exercises and####[]
I don ' t think they required and explanation other than what was there when you actually completed the exercise .####[]
Other than that , I feel that I learned quite a lot , and am grateful####[]
I took this course : ) Thank you Raj !####[]
I have watched all the videos provided for this course and I think it ' s very educative , simple and well organized for a better understanding .####[]
The only thing I think lacking is example of real conflict situations like those between and within states , those between citizens and their elected governments etc . and conflict resolution skills or approaches used both nationally and internationally to resolve them .####[]
Thanks again once more for such a wonderful lesson on conflict resolution , it ' s####[]
My pleasure to learn from the online courser classes .####[]
Introduction is much more than this course is , in my respectful opinion .####[['NULL', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'Introduction is much more than this course is']]
When I read the information on the specialized program , I thought it was something more compact , more useful in the face of the video game industry .####[]
However , this program of courses is rather a paltry touchdown , an insignificant approach .####[['program of courses', 'course quality', 'negative', 'paltry touchdown , an insignificant approach']]
I think it should be underlined that it is a course for those who have never had any experience in videogames development .####[]
Considering all this , is a great course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'great']]
You have to be objective .####[['NULL', 'course quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
The content was very useful , especially the lessons that focused on applying the scientific method to computer science .####[]
I liked the fact that most concepts were taught , and then reviewed again at the end of a video , solidifying what I learned .####[]
I did find the quality of the videos to be rather lacking .####[]
As someone who develops online courses for a living , I suggest using two cameras so that you can switch between two views when a cut is needed to prevent jumping or leaving mistakes in videos .####[]
The professors definitely seemed nervous , but I suppose that goes away with time .####[]
Thank you for this awesome course !####[]
