besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues , the way of teaching is well adapted to on - site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together ; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google ( or stackoverflow or whatever ) really ? ! somehow it seems they just took an on - site course , played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC . they seem not really aware of the fact that on - site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC ( Dr .

While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists , I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance : picking up litter , photographing it , and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography , unless the artist ' s message is in documenting our ' throw - away ' society and highlighting the importance of ' recycling ' for the benefit of the environment .####[['discussions in the videos', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'lack substance']]

The lessons felt very unstructured , unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn ' t know they were being recorded , this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an " introduction to . . . course .####[['NULL', 'course quality', 'negative', 'lessons felt very unstructured'], ['NULL', 'course quality', 'negative', 'unplanned'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'negative', 'ad hoc'], ['NULL', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative', "presenting didn ' t know they were being recorded"], ['examples', 'course relatability', 'negative', 'NULL']]

In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material .####[['material', 'material quality', 'negative', 'low quality']]
The following are my notes and suggestions : - - I found the lectures highly redundant , with many unnecessary repetitions - - using a vector notation ( like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters ) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable - - too much hand writing on the slides while talking : a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable - - very very poor video editing ( many times it ' s clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut ! ! )####[['lectures', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'highly redundant']]
- the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology , which would be more correct and easier to understand .####[]
Just realize that ML is basically applied math , and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject####[]

Healthcare consumers actively explore health information and make decisions about their health .####[]

It is very important that health information should be accessible to people and medical staff directly related to patients , and I think that the process of health information delivery should be appropriate to the degree of need of acquiring personal information of medical consumers .####[]

The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple , but is not applicable to a large set of problems , only to the particular dataset that is given ( and the characteristics of this dataset is not given ; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset , which makes the problem more difficult ) .####[['NULL', 'assignments quality', 'neutral', 'simple']]

I ' d like to see more clearly is that , during the course , all annual interest rates are converted into monthly rates just dividing by 12 .####[]

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments .####[['NULL', 'presentation relatability', 'negative', 'not entirely helpful'], ['Professor Kaul', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'inspiring']]
