We are getting basic ideas , but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly , with NO examples / limited examples , which is what will teach us the most .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'basic'], ['NULL', 'material quality', 'positive', 'NULL']]
Then , we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and it ' s very difficult .####[['NULL', 'polarity neutral', 'positive', 'difficult']]
Instead , too much time spent on videos of " role playing " - just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them .####[['NULL', 'presentation workload', 'negative', 'NULL']]
Furthermore , the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the time .####[['professor', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'difficult']]

The problems are interesting , the course is great .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'great'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'interesting']]
However , the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well - defined , which makes it really difficult to solve ( especially the dataset problem ) .####[['NULL', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'NULL']]
The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple , but is not applicable to a large set of problems , only to the particular dataset that is given ( and the characteristics of this dataset is not given ; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset , which makes the problem more difficult ) .####[['NULL', 'assignments quality', 'neutral', 'simple']]

It is definitely a beginner ' s course , and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
I really think there should be an option for people who aren ' t absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and / or do the capstone .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
After all , this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science , which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
For what it is , though , namely a very beginning level course to teach the concepts of programming with Python , it ' s very well executed .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL']]

I would say this course expects more from students than other courses .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas .####[['NULL', 'course general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
For the assignments you will spend a lot of time in the Pandas documentation and Stack Overflow .####[['assignments', 'assignments workload', 'negative', 'NULL']]
I don ' t know about others , but this lead to my code being very clunky and not Pandorable code .####[['NULL', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'NULL']]

He definitely put some thought in the perspectives of non - engineers . that calming sentence , " you don ' t have to worry about this " - After the week 6 , the assignments focuses less on how to use the algorithms , but more on the pre / post processing .####[['assignments', 'assignments relatability', 'positive', 'NULL']]
Great course .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Great']]
Lot of complicated detail segmented and described in a way that was easy to digest .####[['NULL', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'easy']]
the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe .####[['course', 'course quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works it ' s clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course ) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done . further to the course timeframe )####[['course', 'course workload', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['course', 'course quality', 'negative', 'disappointing']]
The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions , which is very strange in a course for coaching .####[['assistance', 'faculty response', 'negative', 'NULL']]

Beware this course , especially if you are new to this area ( despite what the course / specialization says ) .####[['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course , but what ' s worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos , so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments / projects satisfactorily or smoothly .####[['NULL', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'few'], ['assignments', 'assignments relatability', 'negative', 'worse'], ['project', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'much'], ['assignments', 'assignments relatability', 'negative', 'NULL']]
